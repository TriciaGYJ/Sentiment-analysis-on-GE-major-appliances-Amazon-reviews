Even if GE is compatible with NFS/ANSI 56 and the Waterfall Filter meets NFS/ANSI 42 and not 56, your county water companies many times have to meet even more stringent health standards than 56.  No worry, we will purchase this filter again. Cheers &amp; good drinking!",8/30/15

GE MWF SmartWater Compatible Water Filter Cartridge - Refrigerator,5,Y,Happy with the filter,"Pretty happy with the filter. Delivered fast and easy to install. It also has a good build quality.  Increased flow slightly so that was good. Excellent follow-up from the filter company. I filled the filter with cold water then installed it. You should then draw water through it for a few minutes to get rid of the filter taste then you are all set. I live in South Florida and our water is already good, so the filter mostly just removes any chlorine taste. Will definitely purchase again.",8/29/15

GE Part Number JXDD44R ACCESSORY,4,Y,Arrived the same day it was shipped????,"Ordered this to replace an existing GE griddle that had begun to crack and peel after many years of use on high heat -- mailing to cook pancakes and home made flour tortillas.  The one thing that concerned me was that my wife and I ordered this item just before we left from a 5 or 6 day road trip.  Two day later we got a notice that the item shipped (on a Friday) and was due to arrive between the following Wednesday and Saturday or some 6 to 10 days later.  However, the next day (Saturday) when I checked to see where the package was it said it was delivered Friday &#34;left on porch&#34;  the delivery note said -- so it arrive the same day it was shipped.  Luckily this was not a $1,000 piece of electronics.<br /><br />The item itself is just what we thought it would be and looks very similar to the one we replaced, although my wife thinks the metal is a little thinner than the original.  Might be, but the last one lasted almost 20 years, so if we can get close to that on this it will be well worth the money spent.",8/28/15

I just moved into a new place and wasn't sure how old the water filter was. I purchased this to replace the HDX model in the fridge. I ran a few gallons through it, then we noticed a day later that our water was yellow and there was buildup in the bottom of a water bottle we had filled. We thought maybe it had been that way since moving in since this was a brand new filter - then I looked in the ice maker where you can clearly see the new ice from this filter is yellow and disgusting. No idea what that yellow is but it absolutely came from this filter, which was new in box and fully sealed. Gross!",8/26/15

"GE GLDT690DWW 24"" White Fully Integrated Dishwasher - Energy Star",2,Y,Spend a little more,"I am so disappointed with this product. I can't believe it is a GE. I had to replace our wonderful Asko after many years of good service. Because our counters are 1/2&#34; too low for standard height dishwashers and we live in a remote area, I had very limited choices available that I could buy online and I couldn't actually see it before I bought it. After one load, I can make only two positive points: 1) the unit fits under our counter, and 2) a reasonably gooey load of dishes did get clean and reasonably dry. The racks, rollers, utensil baskets and spray arms are made of flimsy plastic. Although the unit is the same size as the Asko, the racks are only 17&#34; deep (instead of 19&#34;). The top one only pulls out part way, reducing capacity and making it hard to load and unload. I don't know what &#34;fully integrated&#34; means. It does NOT mean quiet. After rattling and roaring on for nearly 2 hours on the first load, the wretched thing created a further commotion by flashing a whole string of green lights and making intermittent beeping sounds to celebrate the fact that it had completed its cycle.  This continued until I got up and manually turned it off. I'm glad it was happy, because I just wanted to cry. As for Square Trade, the jury is out. They promised &#34;same day&#34; shipping on July 19. It shipped on July 28 and finally arrived on August 4. The 3-year Square Trade Large Appliance Protection policy has yet to arrive. Somehow, I suspect I'm going to need it, although I might be happier just letting the thing die an early death. I would wait to write this review until I had more to report, but I've given myself only 48 hours to think about how annoying this dishwasher is before I pretend it just doesn't exist.",8/15/15

It performs as expected however the mounting hardware has changed slightly and needed adjustments to hang the new oven on the existing bracket. It came with a grease filter however the case design has changed and there was no way to install it without disassembling the entire shell of the unit contrary to the illustrated instructions.<br />My only real complaint is that the touch control panel still is not lit.  With a dozen options all looking identical, it's impossible to even select the surface light switch without having to put on overhead lights. Aggravating but not a deal breaker.

"GE Cafe CGP650SETSS 36"" Built-In Gas Cooktop",1,Y,Disappointed,"We recently purchased a GE Cafe gas cooktop in our home kitchen. We have had other GE appliances in the past, and have found them to be reliable, quality products. But we cannot say the same for this cooktop. By the second time we used it to cook dinner, two of the knobs had broken. These knobs control the gas to the burners. They are stainless steel handles with a thin plastic stem that engages the control valve. The stems split, allowing the knobs to turn without turning the valve stem. On one occasion this made it difficult to tell if the gas had been shut off, while on another we were unable to shut off the flame. <br /><br />Because the knobs break easily and can turn without operating the gas control valve, the gas could potentially be left on. We are also worried that there could be more instances of the flame being unable to be shut off at the cooktop. Both of these situations could lead to serious injury. A search of the internet leads us to believe that this problem has happened many times previously, and that GE has been made aware of the problem some time ago. Why has it not been fixed? We expected better from the GE reputation and from our past experiences, and are sorely disappointed. We plan to contact GE Customer Service to see if there is any remedy. We have also reported the problem to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",8/5/15

The good news:  this version is a VAST improvement of the last GE in this size.  It's only a little taller than the last on the interior, but that little bit makes a huge difference:  we can now fit virtually everything we need in the microwave.  They added on some other features that bring this microwave into this century (turn table, more auto settings, etc.).

GE GTDS560EFWS 7.0 Cu. Ft. White With Steam Cycle Electric Front Load Dryer,1,Y,Great if you like wet clothes,"I've had many different driers over the years, and they've all dried clothes. The only differences were capacity, heat source, and features. It didn't matter the capacity, the heat source (gas or electric), or the features, they all had one thing in common, they dried your clothes. The permanent press cycles are nice, the cool down cycles are nice, infinite temperature settings are nice, but they are all worthless if it doesn't ultimately dry your clothes in a reasonable amount of time.<br /><br />Then there's this drier. It is the absolute worst drier I have ever used. It will not dry a load of clothes on one dry cycle. Doesn't matter how many clothes are in the drier, how long the cycle is, the temperature of the cycle, items never come out dry. And I don't mean a little dampness or slight cool-to-the-touch around the waist line, I mean wet.  It always takes at least 2 cycles, and often more, to get them dry. Especially towels.  I will be up half the night restarting the drier every 75 minutes or so just to get one load dry!  It must have 15 different drying cycle types, and it doesn't matter which one you use, everything is still is wet on completion.<br /><br />This is the only computerized drier I've ever purchased, and it will be the last. Give me a good old mechanical dial for the amount of time and a 3-position switch for setting the temperature any day.",7/18/15

Filter had the refrigerator product number listed, fit correctly but water would not flow thru, then had a water leak, GE repairman came and water valve was cracked, apparently the filter is not a fit and because of water not flowing thru pressure built up and caused the water valve to fail.

"GE PGS950SEFSS Profile 30"" Stainless Steel Gas Slide-In Sealed Burner Double Oven Range - Convection",3,Y,"Gorgeous oven, but no safety lock, odd smell...  *** UPDATED ***","It took a lot longer than expected to arrive, but when it finally did, we loved it.  This oven is gorgeous, so so so much better than the ones with a back panel and looks very high end for a middle-range price.  I've cooked in the top, convection oven for about a month, and it doesn't seem to be much faster than my old oven, however I don't have any complaints with the cooking capabilities.  As others have said, the double oven is a great benefit, but takes some getting use to, as the lower oven is quite low and a bit awkward, but I will probably use the upper oven 95% of the time.<br /><br />My only complaint is that there doesn't appear to be any safety lock!!  I have scoured the owner's manual and the oven itself and can't see any way to lock the doors.  I have a 1-year-old that just started to walk and despite my efforts to keep her away from it, the low oven door is like a magnet for her.  I will probably not use the bottom oven for that reason until she's older, or I've figured out a way to secure it.<br /><br />*** Update ***.  I still like this beautiful oven, but we have encountered a few problems and thus I reduced my review to a 3.  First, there's a very odd smell EVERY time we turn on the oven that lingers for at least 5-10 minutes.  I Googled it and most people said it was normal with a new oven, but after 4-months and use 3-4x per week, it's not new anymore and the smell persists.  We are on Propane, so maybe that has something to do with it, but we never had that smell with our old oven.  Perhaps related to the smell, but there is also a build-up of some sort on the inner door.  I wipe it off every few weeks, but it doesn't come completely clean.  It's like soot?  Also, I thought the convection oven was supposed to cook better / faster?  It does not in my experience - no different than my old non-convection oven.  We never solved the lock problem, but I generally only cook in the upper oven and my daughter is content playing in all my cabinets for the time being.<br /><br />(ps... the picture is during a renovation)time being.<br /><br />(ps... the picture is during a renovation)",7/16/15

I thoroughly ran water through the system.  There is a distinctively different taste to the water than I had with the original GE filter and from what I have with my  Brita filtered water pitcher. It is a rather flat taste which reminds me of the electrolyte prep one has to drink before an endoscopic GI tract procedure.  I am trying to give the filter more time and me more time to adjust, but I really want to run out and buy the more expensive GE filter to get back the refreshing taste to which I was accustomed. Have others experienced this?  Is there anything I can do to change this taste?",7/15/15
GE GTWN7450HWW 5.0 Cu. Ft. White Front Load Washer - Energy Star,5,Y,Awesome Washer,"Maybe it's because the washer that came with my house looks like it's from the 60's, but I am completely amazed by how awesome of a job this washer does.<br /><br />Design [5/5]<br /><br />The design is very simple - can be considered minimalist. The washer offers a ton of options, but the simplistic design keeps you from feeling overwhelmed. The best part is that the washer is deep and can fit a ton of clothes, but the unit itself does not take up a ton of space.<br /><br />Performance [5/5]<br /><br />With a simple turn of a knob or a click of a button you have an arsenal of options at your fingertips to determine the best wash for your clothes. At first I was a little surprised by how long it takes to do a full load (roughly 50 to 60 minutes), but once you experience how amazing the rinse cycle is, then you start to understand, and appreciate why -- the clothes come out damn near dry which SIGNIFICANTLY cuts down on how long the clothes need to be in the dryer, which actually saves you more time in the long run.<br /><br />TIP: As other reviewers have noted, make sure you place your clothes in a donut shape around the center of the washer. Make sure that the middle is always visible. This will give you an amazing wash EVERY TIME.<br /><br />Overall [5/5]<br /><br />If you are looking for a great priced washer that will perform well beyond your expectation, then look no further!",7/15/15

It worked fine before this filter.  I'll be getting my money back but now my water/ice system is completely broken and I'm buying water at the store and making ice.  ABSOLUTE CRAP. CRIMINAL MISREPRESENTATION.  Update: posting a picture. Two hours today working on this, and found the problem. The grinding noise I heard was the filter grinding down the plastic piece that has to be engaged for the water to flow. Replacing this part will cost me $197 at GE, and that's if I do the labor. Save yourself some money and don't buy this filter!!!",7/6/15
GE JES1451 Countertop Microwave Over,5,Y,"Very nice, so far so good!","I am extremely pleased with the quality of this microwave oven. Frozen meals heat evenly but quickly, and there's a substantial amount of room inside the microwave. Until now all of my microwaves have been 1.1 cubic feet,  but this 1.4 cu GE was listed at a comparable price to the much smaller ones, so that was why I decided to buy it.<br /><br />I will update this review if anything changes in the future.<br /><br />Edited to update: After a month of use, I am still completely satisfied with the purchase of this microwave.",7/6/15
"GE Profile PHS920SFSS 30"" Profile Series Slide-in Electric Range with Smoothtop Cooktop, in Stainless Steel",3,Y,"Great stove to use, Questionable reliability, Crazy Maintenance Policy","My wife is happy with how the stove works. There is a long learning curve she says. She had a JennAire for the last 25 years and it was still working when I decided to be nice and insisted on buying a fancy new stove. Also, it heats very fast so I made several messes before I learned not to put something on and walk away expecting it to take a while to boil.<br /><br />However, the reliability and maintenance was pathetic. It just stopped working one day after using for 3 months. It would beep and quit, both burners and oven, after a couple of seconds. It took a week to schedule GE maintenance. He arrived Friday at 5:00pm and was very professional. Unfortunately, they don't give them any diagnostic tools or training for this stove. So he guessed and ordered two new boards and a wiring harness. We waited another week for the next visit on a Friday evening. New parts did not fix the problem. He guessed again since he couldn't get help over the phone. He ordered more new parts and explained that actual diagnostic work is normally done over a phone with technical guys on the East coast. That doesn't work at all on a Friday evening from Seattle. Anyway they replaced just about everything electronic in the stove before they finally got it to work. Took 4 1/2 weeks which is a bit long to be without a kitchen stove. I even got tired of steak on the barbecue. GE extended my warranty for 6 months for the hazzle which wasn't very much considering the new stove was my idea which my wife remembered, more than once.<br /><br />My lessons learned are (1) Be wary of fancy automated appliances (2) Schedule maintenance calls for the morning only (3) Buy the extended 5 year warranty since they told me the last part would have cost $1,300 if I would have had to pay for it (4) Steak every night gets old.",7/5/15

Only complaint is my hot-water heater doesn't work anymore, however it was almost never used, so I don't even know when it broke. It was covered by warranty and it was repaired for free. I don't really care much about it so it doesn't affect my review, but others might.<br /><br />Mine has almost no noise, nothing more than what it sounded like on day one (I've had it for nearly 2 years now).<br /><br />The freezer is super cold, it actually goes below the temp you set it to, so mine's set a little &#34;warmer&#34; than recommended. No complaints about the freezer. It is a little small, but the drawers do help with holding alot of things.<br /><br />The actual fridge portion of it is great, The drawers are smooth, the doors are strong, I have 4 kids and they sometimes slam the fridge and it's still going strong. No creaking, it didn't misalign, no gaps or leaks.<br /><br />The touch screen is good, seems to be a little water-tight or water resistant. The features offered are all great.<br /><br />Do not use non-standard/Non-OEM filters! I bought a 3 pack of non-oem filters and they slowed down the flow of the water dispenser to a crawl. The water pressure was non-existent. They cost ~50 for 3, vs the ~40 for 1 OEM filter, so you can expect it to be not as good.",7/1/15

"GE JVM3160RFSS 30"" Over-the-Range Microwave Oven in Stainless Steel",5,Y,Installation a little Tricky but Super Quiet when Running,"When our old over the range microwave went out, we bought a counter top one instead. We dont have a lot of spare counter space so eventually, we really missed not having an over the range one. This has been exactly what we needed again. The installation was a little rough - as other reviewers said, do not expect the drilling template to line up with the holes, you will have to wing it most likely. Also, there was one part of the instructions that my husband said did not make sense and since he's pretty handy at fixing and building things anyways, he went ahead and did like he thought it should have been.

When the refrigerator arrived we did as instructed and checked the refrigerator for any damage. We did not see any damage and readily accepted the refrigerator. However, two days later  when we were getting ready to install it, as we were removing the plastic covering and &#34;masking&#34; tape type from the refrigerator there is a marked under the tape where the paint had come off. My initial thought was we were going to have a damaged fridge since it was past the returned timeframe. I emailed Appliance Connection and explained what happened. Too my very pleasant surprise I in a very short period of time received and email from a gentleman, named Mark with his phone # asking for me to give him a call. An actual phone # for a live person. Wow, I was impressed. He made arrangements for a new door to be shipped to us and for the GE technician to come out and replace the door. I would not hesitate one bit to order something through Amazon if Appliance Connection is in the loop. They truly do deliver exceptional service, which is so rare in this online world.<br />My rating for the fridge probably a 4. The ice maker is extremely slow.

"GE GTW485ASJWS Energy Star 4.2 Cu.Ft. Top Load Washing Machine with 16 Cycles, White",4,Y,Good Washer But Slow Delivery,"I'm very happy with this washer so far. I have yet to try the &#34;auto load sensing&#34; feature (which may be what others are complaining about with the water levels being low?), but when choosing small, medium, large, extra large or max settings it washes our clothes just fine (even with the abundance of dog hair usually present on our clothes). I also washed our Queen sized bedspread in it and was happy with the results. We decided on this model after our front load washer died at only 2 years old (top load models seem so much more reliable because there are not so many electronic features). After some research we had it narrowed down to this model or one from Sears. This washer won due to the quicker delivery time listed. Which brings me to my reason for the 4 star rating instead of 5…. This product lists a delivery time of approximately 1 - 1.5 weeks. After you purchase it you get an email from the company stating that actual delivery time is 1 - 3 business days of processing time + 7 - 10 business days of shipping time. I was a little bit annoyed that this didn't match what Amazon said, but I thought, &#34;that's still pretty fast.&#34; 2.5 weeks later I was emailing the company for an update, and 3.5 weeks later our washer was finally delivered. I felt very mislead, and wish the seller would update their delivery estimate to something more realistic. So if you're in need of a washer quick, don't believe the timeframe listed. If you're in no hurry though and looking for something affordable, this washer seems good so far. I will be sure to update my review if anything goes wrong with it down the road.",6/5/15

"GE Cafe CGP650SETSS 36"" Built-In Gas Cooktop",2,Y,(Not So) Fantastic!,"Love the power boil center flame. Love the griddle for pancakes and grilled cheese. Love the way it looks. Love the strong, solid feel.<br /><br />Update: 2 years later... the cooktop looks and feels heavy duty, but it isn’t. At the top of my complaints are the control knobs ($45 each from GE, about $25 on Amazon). These knobs are on plastic stems that break easily. I have purchased at least 12 replacement knobs at this point!!!  Right now I need a new gas value for one of the burners that no longer turns, and see my warranty was only 12 months and the replacement part is over $200. Cooktops used to last forever. Now it seems you have to pay for them over and over again in expensive parts that could have been made to last in the first place.<br /><br />Other than that, the stainless steel has scratched a lot and a few rubber bumpers have disappeared. I could live with that type of wear and tear I guess, but the poor quality of the knobs and now the valve are really disappointing.",6/4/15

I see no difference from the GE MWF filter except that we are saving money! The company also sent an email with helpful information about the filter. With our last replacement a few weeks ago, I had it for a week or more before replacing the old one. We followed instructions as printed and the new filter worked normally for a few days, then suddenly water stopped flowing from the refrigerator door water dispenser. At first we thought it was a refrigerator issue, but after removing the filter and rinsing it, water began flowing again but very slowly. Before I took the time to report the issue to Amazon, two family members were in a bad car accident. I was finally able to follow up with the report today and see that the return window has now closed, so we are apparently stuck with a bad filter until we replace it again.",5/29/15

There is no comparison between induction and radiant, it was well worth the extra money to go with induction. The GE unit is well made and looks high end and temperature adjustments are well incremented. One big benefit of induction is the surface never reaches the extreme temperatures of radiant which should result in the top looking new longer as opposed to the usual radiant burn rings in the glass surface that develop after a few months of use.",5/28/15

GE Spacemaker GTUN275EMWW,4,Y,First-floor laundry....yea!!,"I got tired of going to my dungeon of a basement to do laundry. My first-floor bathroom had a tub, vintage 1960-ish, that we never used. I had the tub taken out, and in its place put the stackable W/D and had a small open area built with 2 shelves and a rod for hanging clothes next to it. The 27&#34; unit is about as big as my regular W/D - no problem getting a good-size load of laundry in there! The washer has a different sound from most full-size ones, and at first I thought something was wrong. The book explained that it is normal because of the kind of agitator used. My only complaint is that there are SO many settings on the control dials that you'd think NASA made it. Guess I just have to get used to it as I use it more and more. One more thing: many of the small stackables have all the controls on TOP. I wanted them in the middle so my 10-year-old granddaughter can help with laundry sometimes, and she could not reach the high ones. Otherwise, I might have ordered the Whirlpool.",5/15/15

GE MWF SmartWater Compatible Water Filter Cartridge - Refrigerator,1,Y,Strong Chlorine Taste,"Normally I buy GE-maded filters, but this time I decided to save a few dollars on a &#34;GE Compatible&#34; filter.  This was a mistake.  We live in a large suburban area with high water quality standards.  We filter our drinking water to improve the taste.  Not long after I installed this filter, various family members began complaining about the chlorine taste in our drinking water.  It wasn't subtle.  It tasted like pool water.  I scratched my head to figure out the problem b/c I had just put in a new filter.  There must be a problem with the city's water, I thought, because the water from the fridge is always good, and I know the filter is fresh. This was early March.  After waiting some time and continuing to notice it as a problem, it dawned on me.  I had purchased a cheaper filter.  It's too late to return this one, but I wanted to let others know of our experience.",5/13/15

"GE PHP900DMBB Profile 30"" Black Electric Induction Cooktop",5,Y,Cheers for Induction!!,"I was so happy to find this at Amazon.  I tried to but it locally, but our local store had NO induction cooktops on the floor.  It is such a shame because this is the best cooktop I have ever used.  I was unsure about buying a cooktop on line partly because I had never seen one before,  I don't even know anyone else who has one,  and, it is an expensive item.  All this means nothing.  It is the GREATEST!!  It heats up fast.  Very fast.  Temperature control is very, very easy and precise.  I can heat up a cup of water on the cooktop faster than in the microwave. When you turn down the heat you can immediately see a change boiling water.  when you turn it down to a simmer, it immediately cools down to that setting and stays there until you turn it off.  The cooktop remains cool except for directly under the pot.  I have not had anything burn onto the surface.  Everything washes off easily.  The cooking surface cools quickly, it is only hot because the pan on it gets hot.  If you are thinking about replacing a cooktop, this is a guaranteed winner.  We absolutely love it.",5/5/15

"GE JVM3160RFSS 30"" Over-the-Range Microwave Oven in Stainless Steel",3,Y,Nice Enough Microwave - Some installation issues.,"Nice quiet Microwave Oven.  Attractively finished.  The way the controls work are much different from the last oven but I found these convenient.  At this time we've only had it in use for two weeks so it's not clear how easy it will be to keep clean or how durable it is.  The door is plastic with a decorative stainless overlay and durability may be an issue.  I would likely have rated this a bit higher but typical of these under the cabinet units the oven hangs from a bracket applied to the wall (studs hopefully)  And the front is attached by bolts through the cabinet.  Note that this is not recommended for a cabinet more than 12 3/4&#34; deep (mine is being used as a recirculating vent without top or back vent ports),  Our cabinets are 12&#34; deep which is pretty typical. The bolts are located in such a way that the heads interfere with face frame on the inside of the cabinet.  In addition the nuts installed inside of the case are held in place with spring clips, until the bolts are installed.  We found it surprisingly easy to knock one of these out and very difficult to replace it.  Be very cautious in installing the cabinet bolts (3) so that you don't loose these nuts.  The outside of the case is held on in several locations with tamper resistant screws which we were unable to remove and if you were to knock one of the two panel nuts out at the controls end while installing the microwave you'd probably have to return the unit.  That said by this time you'd have destroyed the box it came in as you cut it apart to remove the microwave - Catch 22.  Regards",5/3/15

See https://youtu.be/UgC0pJ62Uuo  Some people have noted than the cooking burners are difficult to see on the cooktop and indeed this is true. I have remedy for this. I purchased a kit of &#34;Color Coding Labels&#34;, get the small ones about 1/4&#34; in diameter. Yellow goes well with the black background. I placed a color code label on the sides and bottom area of each burner and about 3/4&#34; away from the burner. Don't clean the cooktop surface with water or you will wash the dots away. Use the cleaning stuff that comes with the cooktop. Here is a video on how to use the color coding labels to make the burner outlines more visible. See https://youtu.be/jEr13xLfPIo",4/21/15

"Genuine Aprilaire Humidifier Maintenance Kit 4839 - For Models 600, 600A, and 600M",5,Y,Humidifier Maintenance Kit,"I dropped the ball on maintaining my humidifier.  If you have hard water like I do, the water pad needs to be changed out every 3-4 months for best performance.  I let it go so long this winter that the calcium build up on the pad had cut evaporation by 40%+/-.  And not just the pad, but the frame that holds the pad and distribution tray had a lot of calcium build up - too much to soak away in vinegar.  Any, I needed a new frame, tray and pads.  I ordered a &#34;Maintenance Kit&#34; from Filters Now; good price and good rating.  The maintenance kit includes everything you need including some parts you probably won't need.  The kit was shipped the next day, arrived on time, and the product was as advertised.  Instructions come with it.  I also ordered an extra set of water pads, interesting however, was the best price for just a two-pack of pads was at Best Air.  I got the extra pads so I can install a fresh pad while soaking the used pad in vinegar overnight (I use a deep disposable roasting pan large enough for both pad and frame too.  If you rotate the pads often enough and overnight soak in vinegar will return the pad to almost good as new.  After a while you will need to get new pads as the vinegar over time does effect the special coating on the pad filaments.",4/14/15

Stainless Steel French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,3,Y,Kinda sucks since it was the first day I got it,Shipping company that brought the fridge could barely get it inside my house and it was a hassle to get them to open the box. They still didn't hook it up or take any of the trash. Also when I unwrapped the fridge completely it's cover in this blue clear wrap. As I was removing it there was some behind the outer door water button. I couldn't get it to save my life. After a out 30 mins of messing with it I finally pulled the water button off and now it's partially broken. Kinda sucks since it was the first day I got it.

GE PSCF3RGXBB Profile 23.3 Cu. Ft. Black Counter Depth Side-By-Side Refrigerator,4,Y,We LOVE this fridge,"We LOVE this fridge. we were originally apprehensive about ordering it online, but in the end, it was worth it. We ordered it from Gochnauer's Home Appliance Center as the seller. I researched them, and found they have a big presence online, and was able to call their online division and ask some questions. The delivery took a little bit, due to ordering it in the winter, and getting hit with two massive storms that shut the highways down, but they got it here, and it was every bit as new as stated. The Delivery guys even moved it into the house and set it in place for us, which was a nice touch. We did not pay extra for the white glove service.<br /><br />The Fridge is excellent. The reduced depth of the counter-depth was exactly what we were looking for. Our fridge is located next to a doorway, and the main cooking area was on the other side. Because of this, the 3 extra inched our old fridge stuck out was very noticeable. Space wise, the fridge is very efficient. we went from a 32&#34; wide whirlpool regular depth, to the 36&#34; counter depth GE, and we actually gained space inside.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the fridge is NOT energy star compliant, although it is close. It also is a little loud at times, particularly when the ice maker is filling, and occasionally when the compressor kicks on.<br /><br />Overall we are very glad we purchased it and probably would consider another GE again.",3/31/15

Almost a couple hours for the regular cycle.  However, we run it at night and don't do more than one load per day so, no worries.  In the past, I have bought a few cheap dishwashers and I am very happy that I didn't do it again.  Think about it, this thing affects every meal and drink you have at your house.  Spend some money on a good one so you don't waste your time and money washing dishes twice, or getting sick from the residue the washer leaves behind.<br /><br />Not only does it clean the dishes very well, but the door springs work well, it makes almost no noise when running and the silverware basket comes out and goes back in easily which is nice.  My old dishwashers made it difficult for whatever reason.<br /><br />We are now only using the 3 in one cascade packets and it is much easier and again, the dishes look amazing.  Even my 8 year old daughter mentioned how much cleaner our cups look after just two times through the wash.  I definitely recommend this washer, it has been wonderful so far.  Also, it shipped quickly and came in perfect condition.",3/30/15

"GE P2B940SEHSS Profile 30"" Stainless Steel Dual Fuel Sealed Burner Range - Convection",1,Y,A headache,"My wife loves it, it will convert your temp when using convection but not the time,  we have found that the times are the same as standard baking because it will adjust the temp per recipe. One thing I could not find anywhere was the dimension of the griddle, the griddle is 8&#34;x13&#34; (cooking area) front end is 7&#34; wide and tapers back to the 8&#34;. The overall including the front handle is 20 1/2&#34; x 9&#34;. We're a family of 5 and it was large enough to do pancakes then eggs in time for our first meal on it.  Warming drawer was very handy keeping our pancakes and sausage warm while I finished the eggs. The brillion feature is really cool, you must turn on the feature before you leave for safety reasons and it can be accessed while your device is off your wifi. I must say it is very beautiful and complements our kitchen well. The oven has coated grates that are very slick so be careful when pulling out with a loaded dish. We're new to cooking with gas but it is not taking long to adjust.  follow up: I've had the product for a few months so I would lIke to share that I have had many problems with the unit.  The igniter on the front right burner keeps going out.  I've had the product worked on 4 times by GE and they still can't get it fixed.  Also don't read the reviews on GE website because they will only allow good reviews.  I posted that I was having problems with the unit and they would not post it. They said it did not meet their guild lines. I guess if it's not bragging on their product then they won't list it.",3/25/15

Being from Germany, I am quite a snob when it comes to the quality of manufactured items - because I am used to high quality craftsmanship. When I received this broiler pan, I was immediately impressed with it: it seems 'sturdy', yet light enough to make it easy to handle; the coating looks durable and uniformly well done (which leads me to believe that I won't have to expect any rust anytime soon!). I used it to broil steaks and was happy to find that the pan didn't need a lot of scrubbing - it was easy to clean. All in all, an amazing buy for this little money!",3/24/15

"GE PGS950SEFSS Profile 30"" Stainless Steel Gas Slide-In Sealed Burner Double Oven Range - Convection",2,Y,Buyer Beware,"Updated review:  I have loved using this range - I cook a lot - until just recently.  All of a sudden, lots of things are going wrong.  I am just past the 1 year warranty.  I did not buy the extended warranty.  Problems.... first, the bottom oven light burned out, now the top oven light will come on at strange times and it won't always turn off when I push the button, also, the bottom oven has started taking FOREVER to preheat, and lastly, the &quot;shut door&quot; message is coming on for the upper oven and the door is shut.  After giving this range a 5 star rating, I'm changing it to a 1 star.  Here's why.  I want to shout loud and clear, &quot;Buyer Beware&quot;.  I've now seen online that others are having major issues with this range, issues that are very expensive to resolve, and negative experiences with GE customer service.  I hope I'll be able to revise this rating, but I'm very concerned about where my experience is headed.<br /><br />Former Review:  Here are many things I love about this gas range!  It is so nice having two ovens - wow!  I also like the 5 burners (btu range is great - from high heat down to a simmer), and the griddle option in the middle is a nice addition.  The top is easy to clean (so much better than the glass top on my older KitchenAid gas range).  This range looks great in our kitchen - very sleek, high quality.  Love it!  The only thing that I don't like are the small gaps in the very back between the range and the counter top  - other reviewers have mentioned this.  It just seems like a weird design element. Other than that, I am really happy with this purchase.  BTW, we did have to convert the range from natural gas to propane.  Even though we are big DIYers, it was pain and was time consuming.  Glad that part's done.<br /><br />Update (4/18/15)  I continue to feel that this is a 5 star purchase.  Using two ovens at once has been fabulous - I love being able to roast vegetables in one oven and bake another dish in the other.  And again, as I mentioned before, the stainless steel top is so easy to clean and maintain, as long as you don't mind moving the burners and griddle to the side to wipe off the stainless (the burners and griddle are heavy duty, so they have some weight, but I don't mind this).  I just used the griddle for the first time this morning - I cooked three pancakes at a time, and it worked great.  Highly recommend this range!again, as I mentioned before, the stainless steel top is so easy to clean and maintain, as long as you don't mind moving the burners and griddle to the side to wipe off the stainless (the burners and griddle are heavy duty, so they have some weight, but I don't mind this).

"GE PHP960SMSS Profile 36"" Stainless Steel Electric Induction Cooktop",4,Y,Love the induction cooking,"Love the induction cooking.  I did have to get a new set of pans that would work, but I need 1 anyway.  The one problem is the the stainless steel trim around the edge has some kind of glue to hold it on and it has come loose after about 3 months and will not stay down.  I will be contacting GE to find out what can be done.  Also, I would caution again the stainless, as no matter how careful you are, it can get scratched.  I previously had an electric stove top, which was always a pain, as it would never cool down fast enough and it was so easy for things to boil over.  Not a problem with induction...it is very close to the same as using gas.",3/21/15

Love the Brillion app to control it from my cellphone. If I can pick at anything, I wish the shelf grates whad rollers instead of grinding metal to metal as you slide the grates in and out. Even with the provided graphite grease they sometimes screech and make your hair stand up at attention. There is ONE roller tray/grate/shelf (whatever its called).

"GE PP989SNSS Profile 30"" Stainless Steel Electric Smoothtop Cooktop - Downdraft",5,Y,"Simple, solid, good-looking, and works like a champ","Ordered this to replace a 1980's-era Jenn-Air downdraft cooktop. We considered both conventional electric and induction cooktops when replacing our old one.  This cooktop was our choice in the end and we're very pleased with it. The things that won us over:<br /><br />* Appearance: Very basic and understated. We wanted something that would not quickly look out-of-style or dated.<br />* Functionality: We wanted a cooktop that included few bells and whistles, with simple controls and zero learning curve. This is the hands-down winner.<br />* Minimal changes required to install: Our install location would have made it difficult to install a separate vent hood or blower. Retaining the downdraft capability of the old unit assured us of being able to control fumes and smells predictably. This unit *DOES* require a 40-amp circuit though (as do most ranges in in the same size range). If you are replacing something more than 10 years old, make sure you take this into account for any replacement!<br />* Predicted reliability/maintenance. The low complexity of this unit (no high-tech components, no expensive timers/computers) means there is simply very little that can fail, short of physical damage. We really were attracted by the alternative of induction cooking, but the complexity of even a fairly basic induction cooktop made me just a bit wary.<br /><br />After using it a few times, I can say that this unit is pretty close to perfect. It heats up MUCH faster than older electric cooktops with metal coil surfaces. Cleaning is simple. The exhaust fan is effective and quieter than we expected. Our installer ran into no complications at all when putting the cooktop in, and the understated, clean appearance makes this a purchase we're 100% happy with.",3/8/15

I was not certain if it was the magnetron and diode  causing the problem, but since the magnetron (in my oven) was 10 years old, I figured that might be the problem. However (after installing the new kit) my General Electric (JEM31WA  002) was still not functioning. So, I ordered new door switches (and after checking my old oven switches) I learned that the &#34;bottom&#34; (Normally open) door switch was not functioning. So, I changed it out, and &#34;voila,&#34; my microwave is functioning perfectly! It took some time, but it is worth it! I don't regret changing out the magnetron and diode (as my old ones were probably on their way out, anyway! (I had not troubleshot  the old magnetron tube. If they are still in working order, perhaps I can use them again, later! My most gracious thanks go out to Martin Microwave Inc. and Amazon; PRODUCT WORKS VERY WELL INDEED!",2/25/15

The glass in the door was totally shattered in the first one I received. The second, I didn't inspect a thoroughly as I should have before I installed it. After it was in, I realized that the front right side had be bent in slightly, so the whole control panel is a bit loose. It works fine, but for a brand new unit, it should not have been damaged.    As far as the unit itself. It works very welll, looks good, and cleans up easily. I do worry a bit, that the dial, which must be spun and pushed to do everything, will be it's achilles heal...but so far, after a little over one year of use, no problems.",2/25/15

GE MWF SmartWater Compatible Water Filter Cartridge - Refrigerator,2,Y,Disappointed. :(,Installation was pretty simple. No complaints. I followed the instructions but had a distinct chlorine taste to the water for about 3 or 4 days after install; long enough that I wondered if I had made a good decision in buying the filter. Thankfully the taste is now gone (about one week later) and everything seems good.  3/16/15 Update Nothing against the seller but this product causes the water to have a distinct chlorine taste. I thought it had gone away but it persists. I don't like it. I'm going to spend the extra ten bucks next time and get the OEM filter which really bugs me because I'm not a fan of GE.,2/24/15

"GE PP975BMBB Profile 36"" Black Electric Smoothtop Cooktop",5,Y,This is the most awesome stove I have ever cooked on,"This is the most awesome stove I have ever cooked on.  SInce I remodeled my kitchen I have cooked more than I ever have.  It is easy to adjust the heat and regulate it to whatever I am cooking and what size pan I am using.  When you turn down the burner, the heat goes down quickly.  I really love the control lock button that stops you from accidentally turning a burner on by accident.  It is easy to do if you are just cleaning it and the control lock button is not lit up.  I also like the button that shows the stove is still hot after you have shut it off....it is red.  When it finally goes off I know I can clean this stove top.  This is the best stove to clean off also....I burned spaghetti on it the first month I had it....a piece of spaghetti fell onto the hot part and caught fire.  After I finished cooking I just followed directions and scraped it off with the scraper I purchased separately and used the cleaner that came with the stove as well as the other little scrubber....wiped all off, shined it up and looked like brand new again.  SO happy with this stovetop.  It has now been 8 months since this was installed and I love it more and more everyday.  Just makest the kitchen look sleek...no burners to clean around, no drip pans.....NOTHING!",2/23/15

"GE Cafe CGP650SETSS 36"" Built-In Gas Cooktop",5,Y,IMPRESSED,"I recently switched from propane to natural gas, and after doing the regulator, and orifices was disappointed in the output on my over 10-year-old Profile cook-top. So, it was off to find a new one. I took about a month to decide.<br /><br />The box arrived undamaged; however, there were a few small scratches on the surface, factory issue, not shipping. They are hardly noticeable with the grates in place. The unit fit almost fit perfectly into the hole from my old Profile cook-top. Set-up and install was less than 30 minutes. I was somewhat surprised that GE suggests using Cerama Bryte on this unit, but there was none included, I guess I just remember the old days when something suggested was supplied, at least in a sample. The straps to hold it in place are really a joke. They really need 2 screws on each strap into the cabinet to stop any motion, but they are just too short. That's an easy fix.<br /><br />I saw some questions here about elevation, so just to give some of you an idea. On the center burner 6 cups of uncovered ice cold water, in a 4.5 quart saucepan came to a boil in 8 minutes. My elevation is 3885'.<br /><br />I like how the grates are slightly higher than others I had looked at. I feel the heat is better distributed on the pan. The low heat levels for simmer are SO much better than my old GE profile. Actually I like all the low level settings much better with this new unit. Change that to LOVE the settings…right now simmering stock on a nice low roll of a simmer on the left front burner, and potato-leek soup on the right front. Oh, it took 18 minutes on the center burner to bring 16 qts of water to a boil, not bad at all. A little surprised how hot the unit gets while in use, even by the controls, that should have been expected, but still a bit of a shock. That's like one of those restaurant things…don't touch the plate, it's hot. Then you still touch it…what can I say, I'm a guy!<br /><br />Using 3 different straight edges I verified I do have a slight bow (maybe 2/16 of an inch) off the counter in the front of the unit. Even though the unit has a foam strip running around the underside of the perimeter, I'm waiting for a reply from GE about using some silicon to seal it.<br /><br />I have not used the griddle yet, I'm more excited about using my wok on the center burner. Even as it was suggested using a flat bottom wok, my round bottom sits quite well on the grates.<br /><br />I am very happy with this purchase. It functions much better than anticipated. This is a definite recommend.<br /><br />Last thing, it was impossible to beat Amazon's price on this baby. No-one came close.<br /><br />Greg",2/11/15
"GE CGP350SETSS Cafe 30"" Stainless Steel Gas Sealed Burner Cooktop",4,Y,Gas on but flame goes out!,I love this cooktop but I discovered the other day that the front left burner when turned almost to low...the blue burner light is lit but the flame goes out with the gas still on!  I tested all the other burners and it's the only one that does this and that is a problem.  Unless a representative  for the company checks the reviews I will need to contact the manufacturer to see what needs to be done to resolve as that is a dangerous situation if I had not realized it went out and left the room thinking it was successfully on low. Outside of this I love this cooktop.  Update:  I looked over the booklet we received with it for troubleshooting issues and we were able to see that that particular one needed to be adjusted with a screwdriver and the issue was resolved.,2/11/15

"GE PP989DNBB Profile 30"" Black Electric Smoothtop Cooktop - Downdraft",4,Y,Cooktop is nice - the exhaust unit is not,"My stove top arrived quickly and was well packed.  It was replacing an earlier model (about 15 years old) of the same brand.  It does heat quickly (about the same as our olderunit)and I like the improvements they made to make the surface area flat around the control knobs.  In short, compared to our older model, there are much fewer places for dirt to collect.  Our old model also had steel borders around the cooking models, and these wore out over time and looked ugly.  This new model gets rid of the borders, which is also a nice improvement.<br /><br />So I would give it 5 stars, except that there are issues with the down draft.  First, the fan unit and exhaust hole protrude much futher down than the previous model.  This gives 2-3 inches of less room to work with, which makes a HUGE difference.  BY the time you put on the rectangle-to-round adapter, you are basically hitting the bottom of the cabinet.  It was impossible  to connect to the existing vent piping, which is very annoying since the old unit was basically the same model, etc.. as this new one.  The only way I was able to get everything to work was to go to a smaller pipe size (down from 6&#34; to 5&#34;) and run the 5&#34; pipe a few inches into the existing 6 inch pipe, and wrap it up with ducting tape.  In the end it worked, but I feel it is a design flaw to have the exhaust protrude so far down,which really limits your options if replacing an existing stove top.  When installed in a standard countertop, you can expect to have less than 2&#34; of room between the end of the exhaust adapter, and the bottom of the cabinet.<br /><br />It also does not come with any clamps to hold it in place (the old unit had long screws for this).  However I justkeep it in place by gravity,and this seems to work fine.",2/4/15

"GE PHP900SMSS Profile 30"" Stainless Steel Electric Induction Cooktop",5,Y,I can't recommend it more highly Induction is the best!  It should be a 10,"This stove replaced an electric in my new house.  Previously I used gas and swore I would never use electric.  This stove is much faster than the professional expensive, Wolf, and cleans up and easy to maintain.  No comparison to prior electric stove, not even in same ball park.  This stove can boil water really fast.  I cook candy on it which takes a lot of time on my gas stoves and requires really hot heat.  I did the same batch of toffee on this stove in 1/3 the time and it was the best batch I ever cooked and easiest to clean up.  If you have never used induction you have to try it you won't be sorry.  Instant on and off like gas but easier to clean than gas or electric because foods don't cook on the cook top.  It always looks nice and clean.  No grates, no burning, just good food.<br /><br />It does take a little getting use to because the heat is hotter and faster than gas and instant off.  It also requires magnetic pans like cast iron or pure stainless.  Sad but my roasting stainless pan won't work to cook gravy after the turkey because it is mostly aluminum.  My pressure cooker won't work either.  This is a little pain but wouldn't give up the stove for anything.  My stainless All-Clad and Lodge cast iron works flawlessly.",2/2/15

GE Black French-Door Refrigerator,5,Y,Great Refrigerator,"We upgraded from a 15 year old refrigerator, so this model blows the old fridge away.  It has ample room in the fresh food storage and frozen food storage areas.  The small shelves on the ice maker door (the left hand door) are not adjustable, but come in handy nonetheless.  The shelves on the right hand door are adjustable and, as advertised, easily hold a gallon of milk.  The LED lights are nice, but I still think a bulb is out when I open the doors, because the LED lights are not as bright as the old kind.  The interior is dim, but you can see well enough.  The doors open and close with ease.  The multi-colored LED lit drawer adds some “coolness” to the fridge.  The water filter is easy to get to and change out.  However, the filters run close to twenty-five dollars a piece.  I imagine a generic filter will come out soon enough that will be lower in price.  There are three places to get ice.  One is in the door of course, another is a small tray inside the left hand door, and the third is in the freezer.  I like that you can turn the one in the freezer off.  The upper tray holds plenty for the two adults in our house.  The freezer is well lit and food is easy to see and get to.  The unit cooled down quickly after initial setup.  We have had the refrigerator for a couple of weeks and, overall, we are very pleased with it.<br /><br />As for shipping, we order online constantly, but we had never order something this big.  However, the price here was more than 900 dollars less than local, so we thought it was worth taking a chance on shipping.  It took about ten days to arrive, but it was in showroom condition when it got here.  Not a scratch on it.  The delivery company notified us via email when they picked fridge up.  We did not hear anything more until a few days before delivery.  They emailed and called on a Friday to let us know the delivery would be made the next Monday.  It arrived within the time window promised.  The delivery guys were nice and helpful.They opened the box so I could inspect it prior to accepting it.  They volunteered to move the refrigerator into my garage.  I handled the actual installation, which was easy for an experienced do-it-yourselfer like me.  There is a lot of packing material inside and out that took a while to remove.  In my case I had to remove the doors to fit the unit through the door of the house, but I choose a 32 inch door.  You might have to remove the door handles if you use a 36 inch door.  Removing the doors and reinstalling them was easy and took about 45 minutes.  I think the handles are held on by allen wrench screws. Once on solid flooring the fridge rolled easily.  After install you lower the front braces to hold it in place.<br /><br />One last thing, the bypass water filter device is pre-installed in the water filter housing.  The refrigerator comes with a water filter, which was taped inside the fresh food storage area.  I mention this, because I was convinced the bypass device was not included since I did not see it anywhere.  It was not until I went to install the filter that I saw the bypass device.",2/1/15

"GE PHP960SMSS Profile 36"" Stainless Steel Electric Induction Cooktop",5,Y,Fantastic!,"We have been using this cook top for about 7 months now, and I absolutely love it!  We had a 25 year old electric range before this so it was like going from a junker to a porche!  The unit is incredibly responsive, I can go from a hard boil to a gentle simmer in a matter of seconds, with our old unit I would have to change burners to do this!  It is incredibly fast, just a few short minutes to boil water for pasta.  It is very easy to clean, most often I only use water but maybe once a week I use the cook top cleaner.  I have read some complaints about the noise and I can honestly say it doesn't bother me.  When simmering or cooking on a lower temperature I don't even notice the sound.  When using a larger pot/higher temperature is makes a gentle humming sound.  Most of my cookware works with this (Le Crueset, cast iron), the few pieces that I did need I picked up at Ikea which were very inexpensive and have worked wonderfully.  I highly recommend this product and would definitely purchase again!",2/1/15

Of course it replaced a 25 year old piece of junk that only cooked in one spot so take that in consideration when reading this review.  The defrost works well without cooking bits of whatever is being defrosted.  It has a soften feature for butter and cream cheese that also works well.  We bought this particular model because it has a ventilation blower that is used above our range.  While it does pull some of the smell, hot air out of the kitchen (it vents to outside), it isn't super effective and must be used on high which is super loud.  When boiling water it always condenses on the bottom and front of the microwave.  I haven't used all of the features and probably never will, but all in all I am happy with our purchase.",2/1/15
"Genuine Aprilaire Humidifier Maintenance Kit 4839 - For Models 600, 600A, and 600M",4,Y,Another Aprilair 400 series conversion,"My house central AC/heat unit is equipped with Aprilair 400 humidifier. It worked properly, but I was concerned about stale water collecting at the bottom of the panel housing. Water did turn green, and introduction of in-line antimicrobial filter together with occasional sprinkling with tea tree oil (powerful antiseptic)  help alleviating this situation to a degree.    I still wanted to convert 400 model into 600 model that uses running water. This particular maintenance kit helped me to achieve this. Previous reviewer described several stages of the conversion, I just want to add that the supplied funnel snaps into the humidifier housing, and fits perfectly. It has 1/2 inch diameter extension to fit a water drain tube (I got a transparent tube from HD to channel water into sump pump) Overall, this kit fits 400 housing with no issues, and I did not need to change 400 humidity controller.    My first results to use the converted humidifier were positive. I needed to maintain above 40% humidity level in my house during the winter period to help my newborn baby to breath easy through the night. I could see that humidifier was running water every time furnace got activated to maintain this relatively high humidity level.    But couple of month later, the setup had a harder time to maintain this level, it could barely keep it around 40%.  I attribute this to wearing out of the humidifier water panel supplied with the setup. It seems that the panel (made of aluminum mesh layers fused together) had some sort of deposits that helped retaining steaming water. These deposits wear out with time, and the panel has much harder time to allow for proper water/air interaction. I had to revert to the original panel, No 45, designed for Aprilair 400 series as it has lots of paper layers to soak in water.  After this, humidifier could easily increase humidity level to a desired value. So I subtract one star for the supplied panel No 35 behavior - it seems strange to me that it \\""wearsout\\"" so fast.",1/31/15

It is quite beautiful and so far, works as claims.  Because it is installed as a slide-in without an upsweep on the countertop, we needed to use the corner trim pieces.

I will agree with other reviews that state the control panel is a bit too sensitive.  Every time I lean over the over to clean or adjust something, I hit the control panel.  Cleaning it is next to impossible without hitting one of the buttons.  Maybe in the future, they can come up with an on/off button for cleaning.  I have used most of the features on this oven and I love it.  Having two ovens is great, even for the two of us.  Would not hesitate to recommend this oven.  Second photo shows installed oven.  We have not yet completed our remodel, so there is no backsplash.",1/24/15

I just love being able to cook more than 1 thing at a time. I used to have a gas oven, so I had to get used to taking a little longer to heat up. No big deal. The first thing I made was 2 apple pies, GREAT, one in each oven. The crust came out super, didn't burn and the pie came out delicious. So glad I  listened to the reviews on this one.

I enjoyed making those customizations since I'm fairly mechanically inclined, but this is not a plug-and-play microwave for those hoping that it will be.<br /><br />The main annoyance with this was the diagram included that was supposed to tell us where to drill the cabinet for the overhead screws so we ended up drilling the snot out of that cabinet. **There's a great suggestion in the first comment on this review for how to avoid this problem!<br /><br />I'm not a fan of the quick start buttons where you press a 3 and it starts cooking for 3 minutes automatically. I'd like the default to be to type in a time and press start but maybe that just takes some time to get used to. Everything else seems good. It's an attractive, solid machine.

"GE PGP989SNSS Profile 30"" Stainless Steel Gas Sealed Burner Cooktop - Downdraft",4,Y,"Looks nice, cooks well, overall pleased!","This is a nice cooktop.  It can be fairly easy to install depending on your situation.  We went from a electric cooktop to gas, so we had to run a gas line which wasn't terribly easy for us.  Also the downdraft connection is rectangle versus round - I think others have mentioned this and yes, it's a pain.  You definitely have to be ok with a hack job, but if you've done much installation yourself you know that very little is actually &#34;standard&#34; and life is full of hacks.  We bought the model with the chrome edge and I am glad that we did.  The hole in our island was just a teeny bit too large and the edging helped mask that.  The electrical plug for the ignitor and downdraft is also oddly shaped so we had to do another hack job to get it to fit into the outlet, but we managed.<br /><br />Once installed and lit, it works well.  The downdraft fan cover isn't as tight of a fit as I would like, but I'm ok with it.  The whole unit tends to get very hot, so be careful of that.  The flame is affected when the downdraft fan is on, but so far, I haven't seen it affect my ability to control the heat or the flame for cooking.  It is NOT easy to clean - but I've had glass top cook tops in the past and I know that none of them are very easy to keep clean. For normal messes I just wait for the unit to cool, remove the grates, clean with water and soap and then wipe down with some glass cleaner.  You can soak the grates if they get messy.  Yes I do find myself taking the whole thing apart after every time I cook something, because I am a very clean person... but in all honestly, the grates help hide a streak or two or a little bit of dust.<br /><br />Overall I am pleased with the purchase.  It looks fantastic on our island and turned my kitchen into a cook's kitchen.  It's a great price as well - this one is one of the most reasonable I have seen.  If we weren't moving in a few years I probably would have bought a higher end model but this is a great in between option forus.",1/18/15

"GE PGS950SEFSS Profile 30"" Stainless Steel Gas Slide-In Sealed Burner Double Oven Range - Convection",5,Y,Happy customer,"Purchased through Amazon Marketplace Home Care Company,  The company is out of Brooklyn New York if you are wondering.  They contacted me via email immediately and the new range was ready for freight pick-up a couple days later.  HCC uses LTL shipping to save the customer money.  LTL shipping basically hooks up a truck that isn't full with a shipper that has something that will fit in the extra space.  In my case a J.B. Hunt truck that makes scheduled weekly run from New York to California got the message to pick up the load.  It took a week to get to California and another week for the local delivery company to call and arrange final shipment to my door.  The box was in perfect shape; extremely well packed by G.E.  The appliance inside was perfect.  Took me about 90 mins to convert from natural gas to propane; kit/instructions screwed to back of range.  I didn't have to make any adjustments beyond those listed in instructions.  Range fit like a glove in my existing 30 inch opening.  The flange extensions on sides fit on top my granite counters perfectly.  For the few people complaining about HCC, my inquiry emails were answered within 24 hrs.  Tracking info was sent as soon as it was in J.B. Hunt's system.  Again, LTL shipping  is why you get such a great price and &#34;free&#34; shipping (obviously, not really free).  Occasionally there may be a bad apple freight company, but the way the system works they don't last long and HCC fully insures the appliance prior to shipment to cover the rare bad apple.  Well worth it in my mind.  For the few complaints about gas leaks; gas ranges aren't rocket science.  I suspect a bad fitting or incorrectly installed fitting from home supply to the pressure regulator...that's the customer side of the hook-up.  Everything inside the range is pretty much what has been used for decades except for the cool electronic ignitions.",1/9/15
"GE PHP900SMSS Profile 30"" Stainless Steel Electric Induction Cooktop",5,Y,What An Improvement!!!,"I searched long and hard for a very good cook-top to replace an old Jen-aire installed when our home was built in the mid-80s.

This GE stood out amongst all other induction units I researched.<br /><br />Installation was very simple, with a easy three wire connection in the pre-existing box.  Just be sure to follow the directions and cap the white supply wire.<br /><br />This product looks nice and works better, exceeding our expectations for ease of use and cooking enjoyment.  After a very short learning curve, we can precisely set the heat range to cook as needed for the dish being prepared.  And yes, we went all-in and purchased new cookware for use on this cooktop.  After adding a few ceramic clad fry pans to augment the stainless,  I don't miss the old aluminum non-stick set a bit.<br /><br />This cooktop boils two cups of tap water in a 4 qt. pan in about 15 seconds!<br /><br />Sears had this product on sale at almost $250 above the price I paid through Amazon.",1/9/15

All of the units features have worked flawlessly, clean up is easy, and we constantly get positive comments on the look of the unit in our kitchen.  Although installation was easy for us since we were remodeling the kitchen, you should read the installation requirements to be sure this will work in your situation.  I found those in the installation manual on a GE website.<br /><br /> A couple of examples that friends have noted would be problems for them include having 40 amp service available, having clearance 12&#34; below the base of the unit, and having about 6&#34; of &#34;open&#34; space from the front of the cabinet all the way to the cabinet floor.  We do have a shelf under the unit but it was easy to cut out the front 6&#34; or so to create this space.  It does, though, limit the under counter storage just a little. The manual notes these clearances are necessary to provide enough airflow to keep the unit's electrical components cool, and I wonder if some of the &#34;early failures&#34; in some of the reviews might be related to overheating if you don't follow these guidelines.  In any case, take a few minutes to think about the installation before you buy.",1/8/15

What an UPGRADE !!!  cooks evenly.  Looks great.  convection works much better than the gallery model - like 2x better.  heat is even.  I like how the heat vents on the bottom of the oven, instead like the Fridg-gallery that put the heat right onto the control board (which failed on our gallery).  Lights up very nice.  well worth it.<br /><br />we are missing the bottom grate for the oven vent - did not come with the unit and will need to contact vendor to get it.  I have not done so yet because the late delivery pushed us into the holidays.<br /><br />They took longer than estimated to deliver it (and it kinda played a game because they didn't honor the Prime timeframe - until I read the legal fine-print which gave a loophole), however, it was a direct fit replacement and in the end worth the wait for the discount.",1/6/15

GE CWS21SSESS Cafe 20.7 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Counter Depth French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,5,Y,Perfect Size/Perfect Look/No Regrets,"I purchased this GE French Door Model sight unseen because none of my local retailers had it in stock but I knew I wanted GE to match my existing appliances and I like the Café Series better than anything else I'd seen from Samsung/Frigidaire/Whirlpool etc.  My experience working with Goedekers has been exceptional. Their responsiveness, courtesy and follow through combined with the 10 year warranty and no sales tax were impossible to beat locally.  The fridge itself looks and performs great. Due to the size of my home and my kitchen in particular, I knew I wanted a counter depth model which wouldn't crowd the space I had. This CWS21SSESS fit the opening perfectly and looks like it was made for my space. I would say that this is not the model to purchase if you have an exceptionally large family or need extensive freezer space although the door shelves are quite deep and nicely adjustable to accommodate gallons of milk and containers of juice.  It's not a flashy model as the lighting is basic with just 2 standard appliance bulbs but the exterior has a clean/professional look that I constantly get compliments on. Unlike another reviewer who had problems with the drawers, I've had no issues.  For me and my needs, it's been a perfect fit and I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.",1/5/15

Over time, the hard vinyl/plastic water feed tube developed a pin hole, likely of wearing against the slot in the casing inlet.

I went to all the consumer reports sites all the dishwasher review sites etc. Everything pointed to this GE model. I did look at the ASKO and Bosch however for price point and features the GE came out ahead. The bottle wash jets and multiple jets also aided my decision.<br />Now some reviews here state that this unit doesn't dry well and that some dishes were dirty, don't let these reviews guide you too much, they should be used as a guide and not Gospel. When i read the manual i found out that depending on the cycle selected and the Hot Water Temperature the dishes will come out wet and you'll need to open the door and pull out the racks to &#34;Flash dry&#34; the dishes. Its all explained in the manual... it must be read.<br /><br />Installation was quite easy with the dishwasher install kit.<br />Ensure the unit is level<br />Make sure your outlet is placed in the cabinet beside the dishwasher space<br />The drain hose is about 72&#34; if you need more than that go purchase it.<br />Its also essential to secure the dishwasher to your cabinets as it will tilt over when the racks are out.",12/30/14

GE PSA9120DFBB Profile Advantium 1.7 Cu. Ft. Black Over-the-Range Microwave - Convection,5,Y,So much more than a microwave...,"Coming from a 10 year old GE Profile microwave, this makes microwaves seem so basic. If all you need or want is a microwave, then this is overkill for you. But if you can use the additional features the Advantium offers, then this is a powerhouse and will really open a number of cooking approaches to the home chef. Being able to use convection and speedcook modes puts a few minutes in your corner when trying to compress time.<br /><br />The Advantium delivers with a very protective box packing and everything needed for vented (to existing ductwork) or direct vent (recirculating in the kitchen) install. Since this unit is over a halogen and induction cooktop, I only needed the same direct venting as the previous unit had. You'll need two people and about an hour from start to finish if you are replacing an identical width unit. More if you need venting mods or carpentry, of course. In my case, we dropped the old GE Profile unit out, uninstalled the old wall bracket, put up the new wall bracket, drilled new holes according to an undercabinet template, reversed the unit fan for direct vent, lifted the unit onto the bracket, and secured with 4 provided screws from the top. Plugged it in and installed an included charcoal filter, then started cooking. Pretty straightforward.<br /><br />A book of Advantium specific recipes that accompanies the unit is a nice touch to ease away from conventional oven based cooking. There is also a DVD and a good owners manual with a lot of info and many important do's and don'ts. Still learning and trying new techniques, picking up tips and tricks, and fine tuning a few time components, but this certainly puts a lot of options at our fingertips to complete meal preparation without a ton of advance study on what the unit is capable of doing. Looking forward to learning more and incorporating a new tool.",12/29/14

This one has a lower BTU simmer burner for those people who can't get the flame down low enough.

I have not tried the griddle attachment yet, but it's very cool how you turn one burner on &#34;griddle&#34; and it actually controls the 2 burners under the griddle.<br />We also love some of the more aesthetic features--like the burner knobs glow blue around them when they're on--no accidentally leaving the burners on.

"GE PHP960DMBB Profile 36"" Black Electric Induction Cooktop",5,Y,) This is the best I have owned,"I have owned this cooktop for 6 months. My third smooth top since 1993 but my first induction type (they are glass and will break if something dropped hits it hard enough, I broke the first two.) This is the best I have owned.<br />When turned off the only residual heat is from the hot pan not the cooktop.Temp control is practically unlimited.<br /><br />Clean up is easy, wipe with a warm soapy rag, rinse the rag, wring it and wipe dry.<br />Once a week or so you can use a smooth top polish after washing.<br /><br />The top does hum, that is, certain pots seem to hum. It's not always the same. Some days are worse than others. Even the weather<br />seems to make a difference.  I've heard much worse with other brands but depending on your sensitivity it can be annoying. The pan material and size makes all the difference. Big pots hum less.  Thick bottoms hum less.<br /><br />There is a cure. I had been using All-Clad but recently bought  'Chantal Copper fusion ' (recommended in a flyer packed with the<br />cooktop)  absolutely no hum. Another good brand I tried is 'Staub' enameled cast iron.  I suspect any brand cast iron would be good.<br /><br />As for the dropped items breaking the top, I bought a foam rubber kitchen mat 34&#34; x 22&#34; x 1/4&#34; thick at Home Depot (They come in several attractive designs), a piece of lightweight 2' x 4' x 1/4&#34; plywood which I cut to fit,  glued moulding along the edges, stained it<br />and set the mat in flush with the moulding. Glue felt pads on the back and you have gained three feet of attractive drop proof<br />counter space.",12/19/14

I have baked cookies and rolls in the convection oven and they came out perfectly evenly colored golden brown. I use the convection roast for a 22 lb turkey and it was awesome; golden on the outside and juicy on the insde. The only thing I would warn people about is that the back of the oven does not have a place for the gas valve that pokes out of the wall. Most ovens have a well in the back, but this oven is flat. We will have to get the gas valve recessed into the wall so that the oven can be pushed in all the way against the wall and does not poke out 4 inches like it does now.

"GE PS950SFSS 30"" 6.6 cu. ft. Capacity Slide-In Double Oven Electric Range In Stainless Steel",5,Y,"So far, I'm in heaven","First of all I researched this range over about 1 year for deciding to purchase it.  Downloaded the manuals etc. I have a prior GE Profile range that had the smoothtop as well as a convection oven and a meat probe.  So more than most, I knew what I wanted.<br /><br />FRONT CONTROLS<br />Having always had a stove that had controls in the back and having seen the prior owner of my house had a range with controls in front, I know that this is what I wanted.  Is it worth the nearly extra $900 this stove costs more than the back control one.  You have to answer this for yourself.  I noted this unit has a meat probe and the back control one did not.  As this is something I would, it is worth it to me.  Some prior reviewers complained about accidentally turning the stove on.  I noted that when I brushed my hands over the controls they reacted, but it took two presses of the burner controls (On, then a temp) to turn them on.  Only when I laid over the stove to replace the vent filter in the microwave above did I get a reaction from the stove and even then it was looking for me to put in a temperature for the bottom oven.  So it does not concern me much.  When my grandkids come over that might change.  However there is a lock functionality that I can use in that case.<br /><br />SMOOTHTOP<br />This is my first stove with 5 burners, the extra one to keep stuff warm.  When I initially got it, I put it on and thought the heat was nearly undetectable. However in a subsequent use it seems okay.  I will use it  It takes something to get used to pressing a button to get to a number versus turning a knob.  I was used to tweaking a bit over medium for some cooking temps.  Now I have to then of pressing the temp to 5-½.  Given this is a slide in range and my prior was a stand alone, the smooth top is above and extending over my counters.  Any spill is likely to go out to the counters.  Also my counters were not at 36 inches, so there is about a ⅜-½\\"" gap under the smooth top over the counter top.  They don't recommend removing the legs and that would be my only alternative (shy of replacing or lifting my counters to fill this gap).  Some people have put a gasket material in there to seal it.  I suspect that will be my route.  So far I'm impressed with the quickness of the heating.  I've boiled water, cooked bacon on the griddle oriented burners and made a few other things.  I'm pleased with it, but I have come from and older model with less Watts.<br /><br />TOP OVEN<br />This oven has an interesting sliding tray, so you can access it easily.  This oven is not a convection, nor does it have a probe in it.  It has a top element and a hidden lower element.<br /><br />BOTTOM OVEN<br />This oven has only a visible top heat element and a hidden lower one, and a convection fan.  You have two racks and a probe outlet.  Part of the reason I bought this unit is due to the convection and probe.  I have discovered that convections can do meat in ½ the time and leave the meat quite juicy.  Turkey and chicken breast are great in this.  My prior convection range (of 17 years) had convection roast and bake as well as a probe, so I had a lot of experience with that one.  I have already cooked a roast convectionally (is that a word?) and was pleased with the results.<br /><br />SHIPPING<br />We purchased the unit through Home Care Company (as the price was great) and they used independent truckers to ship the item.  That meant there was no tracking.  However I received sufficient emails and phone calls to let me know when to expect the range and the time frame they gave me 4-8PM was perfect to work around my job.  The item's packaging was pristine and the truckers unboxed it, so I could inspect it.  A pleasant experience overall.<br /><br />OTHER STUFF:<br />Just some incidentals you may not think about.<br /><br />Since this has 2 ovens you have no bottom drawer to store stuff.  Granted you could just move this stuff to one of the ovens though, but be prepared to remember it before you preheat.<br /><br />Also since this stove has two ovens, there is little room in the back for the 220W plug.  Ours originally had that big bulky plastic cover.  We had to add a flush mounted outlet behind this stove.<br /><br />I noted that the oven vent is in the back top, where there is a lip, versus under the controls in a back control range.  This may not be an issue, but I can imagine it getting greasy on the backsplash more.<br /><br />Be prepared to run the ovens (probably true for most new stoves) for about 10-15 minutes at about 450 when you first get them.  They will stink to high heaven and you won't want food in them when they do.<br /><br />UPDATE AFTER 2 MONTHS:<br />Well it takes a while to learn new habits.  I have turned the oven off twice now by brushing my hand over the controls.  Both times did not notice it. Grr.<br />Accidental turning on is harder as it takes two presses (turning burner on then selecting temp) so not as worrisome.  But, my adventuring cats still give me pause.<br /><br />The bottom oven did a 20# turkey with ease. could probably do up to a 30#.  It was not crowded.  I used convection which cuts cook time essentially in half.<br /><br />The top oven is wonderful on how it keeps temperature. Amazing though how both ovens pre-heat to the same temp at about the same speed.<br /><br />Top surface is going to take a bit to get used to.  I had a smooth top before, but the heat range was different.  I found a 7 on this is like a 10 on my prior one.  Nice but burnt a few things.  Spills on a slide-in stove, versus a stand alone, don't have a well to keep them contained, they will go onto your counter if they are really bad.  Haven't done that yet, but realized  that nothing is stopping it.o remember it before you preheat.<br /><br />Also since this stove has two ovens, there is little room in the back for the 220W plug.

I purchased this cooktop after positive reviews on both Amazon and Consumer Reports. But now that it's installed and I've  used it for little while I'm very disappointed in the power of the burners. Only the middle &#34;power&#34; burner can actually boil water. The other four don't get hot enough. I've actually boiled water on the middle burner, then moved it to the front right burner, and it can't maintain a rolling boil. The top of the grate is at least an inch above the flame. I suspect there's a lot of heat lost out the sides before conducting to the pot bottom.<br /><br />I love the continuous grates. The stainless steel is beautiful. And I like the arrangement of the knobs in the front. I've even used the safety option when using the stovetop for something else. But at the end of the day, a stove is for cooking.

GE WR24X10231 Refrirator Door Gasket Replacement For White,1,Y,Do Not Buy!,"I purchased this to replace a door gasket that had a gap in it.

After the first day it didn't look that much better so I left it there for a total of 5 days. It still had several places that were not back to the original shape. My husband put it on the fridge door and there were gaps everywhere and the door wouldn't even close! The instructions tell you to place the parts of the gasket that is not fitting correctly into boiling water for 10 seconds then run under cold water.

"GE CGP350SETSS Cafe 30"" Stainless Steel Gas Sealed Burner Cooktop",4,Y,"Nice looking, Powerburner works great.","We moved from a 16 year old GE Profile 4 burner gas cooktop to this GE Cafe 5 burner cooktop.<br /><br />Installed it this weekend and cooked: soup in a large 8 qt pot, boiled water, used the griddle for bacon and French toast, sautéed some vegetables.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Powerboil feature works great and boils faster than even the most powerful burner on the previous stove.<br />- The middle burner has a two stage burner -- you can have a very low flame. Great for low simmer or keeping something warm.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The knobs do not come off for cleaning.<br />- The griddle has a very shallow liquid well. If you're cooking bacon, there's not much room for grease. 4 slices of bacon was enough to fill it. There's no way to drain it, so had to resort to sopping up the grease with a paper towel. I will not cook bacon on it again.<br /><br />Things to Consider:<br />- There are 3 grates -- one each over the two side burners, one over the middle burner. These are heavy and you must move them to clean under them. Our old stove had individual grates, so you only moved one to clean underneath.<br />- The cast iron grates scratch the stainless if you're not careful when you move it.<br />- the overall height from the counter to the top of burner is higher than our old stove. We have an over stove microwave and we lost some clearance.<br /><br />I read some reviews that said the height between the flame and the pan was too great. We measured our old stove and measured this. They were both the same, and we measured a number of other cook tops at Home Depot. There wasn't much difference. The issue that some folks my have had may be related to BTU rating of the burners of the old stove, vs the new stove.<br /><br />All in all, happy with the stove.",11/5/14

So the low power is a lot like the medium power and the only low power is the &#34;1&#34; setting. So if you're making something that requires low heat you'd better be careful or you'll burn it. I hope that as it ages it will mellow a bit.",11/2/14

And it arrived promptly, so win/win!  I don't track how long they last (a light on my fridge's front panel tells me when it needs to be replaced), but the filter came with stickers to use to record the install date so I will be curious to see and hope it lasts about 12 months like my GE ones typically have.  UPDATE:  Just bought my second one of these at the end of December 2015, so I think the first one lasted about 13 months.  I am again very pleased with this filter and its price.  We go through a lot of ice and water and the price on this filter is lower than the GE brand, so no complaints!  Will definitely buy again and again.",10/28/14

"GE CGP350SETSS Cafe 30"" Stainless Steel Gas Sealed Burner Cooktop",5,Y,Great Cooktop So Far!,I've only had this cooktop for a week but I love it! I'm coming from a four burner whirlpool cooktop that was a bit cheaper but had a glass surface that got all scratched up and was un-cleanable in the end which is why we wanted to switch to stainless steel. I read the other comments about the knobs and that is a bit disappointing. They are apparently expensive and break easily. For that reason I will leave them on when I clean until I absolutely have to remove them. They do leave enough space between the bottom of the knob and the top of the stove to get a moist cloth under there. They do recommend only using a soft cloth so I'm going to be careful about how I clean the top of the unit. Any brushed stainless steel appliance is susceptible to scratching So I guess there are trade-offs no matter what type of surface you choose. The surface area of the griddle that comes with it Is a bit small but it works well. There just isn't a lot of room. For that I have a large griddle already that I will use on the other two burners if needed. But the griddle itself works well and doesn't stick. I did the usual seasoning technique before I used it and everything worked great. No sticking. Easy cleanup. I do like the backlit knobs when the burner is on. On my previous cooktop I would occasionally forget and leave the burners on because I couldn't see the flame. With the backlit knobs it is very obvious. So for the first week I am giving it five stars. I really like it so far it blows my previous cooktop away. I guess it depends on what you came from And this is far superior to my previous cooktop.,10/26/14

"GE JGB870SEFSS 30"" Stainless Steel Gas Sealed Burner Double Oven Range - Convection",5,Y,"Very nice range, good choice for 5-burner double oven","Very much enjoying this range! I used to have double wall ovens and a Jenn Air cooktop with grill/griddle. We've downsized but this oven gives me most of the benefits that I had with that setup.<br /><br />The small oven is perfect for 95% of the needs for my wife and I, but I do expect the large oven will get a work-out at Thanksgiving when we have at least 7 for dinner. The Power Boil is terrific, and the grill/griddle is very handy and easy to clean.<br /><br />I debated quite a bit between this and the PGB950SEFSS. The main differences:<br /><br />* This model has a porcelain top surface, the 950 is stainless<br />* The 950 has a double-ring, 19,000 BTU boil burner - this has a single-ring 17,000 BTU<br />* The 950 has dual broiler burners, this has one broiler<br />* The 950 has a ball-bearing roller rack (I believe just one of the three) where this has all standard slide racks<br />* $700 MSRP price difference<br /><br />To be honest I prefer the porcelain top surface of this oven aesthetically, but that's definitely a matter of opinion. The other features just didn't add up to $700 for me. I did use the broiler for a small frittata and that worked fine, but I can see how the double broiler could provide more even heat on a larger dish. The Power Boil is excellent on this, I don't see 10% higher BTU making a tremendous difference.<br /><br />I also considered these other five-burner double-oven ranges: Frigidaire FGGF304DLF, KitchenAid HGRS505XSS, LG LDG3036ST, and Whirlpool WGG7550BS.  All have their benefits and drawbacks but the GE has the largest ovens and I got a good price through Amazon.",10/18/14

GE CYE22TSHSS Cafe 22.1 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Counter Depth French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,4,Y,You won't believe how nice this refrigerator really is,"The first thing I must say is that this refrigerator is pricey. Still, we got it for $400 less on Amazon, compared to the closest competitor we could find. Are we happy? I have to say also that this is the most outrageously cool refrigerator I have ever seen. The cabinet depth makes it look like it is built in, so we got this really smooth look with our cabinets. The door ice and water dispenser is really genius since it is all in the door. My wife likes the hot water, but I could live without that. The interior is laid out with excellent storage spaces and lighting. Could not ask for more precise temperature. The noise other folks have spoken about in their reviews is there, but it seems to be so faint it doesn't distract us. You'd have to really be listening for it. I hope it doesn't increase with age, but we will see. Only four stars because of no information on how to upload photos to the little screen. All in, seems to be one solid machine.<br /><br />Update: May 14,2015 -<br />Well, after six months of owning this refrigerator, I figured I would do an update for the folks that are looking at this GE.<br />First off, we had a service call about January which had something to do with the temperature not cooling to the setting, so I was irked that would happen so early on. The bright side is that we called and they sent a tech within a few days, ordered the part and came back and installed it, all free of charge and all pretty quick. We had a chance to talk with the tech that came out and he said these are some good quality appliances. He doesn't work for GE, just a contractor that does their work for them, and an honest guy. He said, and I believe him, that most of them don't have any problems at all, but there are lemons out there. It looks like about 2-3% are actually having issues.<br />On to the use we have enjoyed.....<br />This thing has tons of room for everything, so no complaints about space for storage. The different colored lights are a nice touch.<br />The water dispenser is really well designed IMO. Can fit large pitchers under the spout. The USB port for photos is right there under the water spout and is very easy to load. One thing about that, though, is that you must use a Thumbdrive with nothing on it but the photos you want to load. No folders because you can't select anything.....no mouse or pointer, just pop it in the port and upload, that's all you can do. Still very cool feature. Freezer is enormous. Stainless steel has not been leaving fingerprints for us. I've read some reviews that say otherwise. I guess they must have a pack of dirty little rug rats, but we've not had that problem. It looks just great inset into the cabinets.<br />Last point I would make is that the noise some people complain of, is there. It is so minor that honestly, this Pavlov dog heard it and forgot about it within a few days. If you are a shut in with excellent hearing but no desire to hear music or watch TV, this would give you something to focus and obsess upon. Me? Not so much.<br />All in all, we love it. Would buy again and we recommend it. I keep it at four stars due to the service call early on. If it stays clear till December, I'll up the stars to five./>The water dispenser is really well designed IMO. Can fit large pitchers under the spout.

Generic Mini USB Fridge (RED),4,Y,Good For Storage of Eye Medication,I bought this to keep eye medication in.  The medication is to be stored at 36 to 77 degrees.  The label on the eye drops suggest keeping it in a refrigerator.  This applies both to my wife's medication and mine even though they are different.  This Mini USB Fridge allows us to keep our medication upstairs.  That makes it more convenient for us to take just before bed time.<br /><br />Only the metal plate on the bottom of this Mini Fridge gets cold.  It is not insulated.  The air inside is near or at room temperature.  I do not think this little machine would work good for keeping a can of soda cold.  But I can not say that for sure because I have never used it for that purpose.<br /><br />Our vials of medication come in two sizes; 2.5 and 5 ml.  I have even put some over the counter eye drops for dry eye in there.  They come in 10 and 30 ml sizes.  All of these containers are made out of plastic.  The two smaller containers get cold all over. They are about one inch high.<br /><br />The top of the 30 ml container does not get cold.  It is about 2 inches tall.  This larger container does not have the temperature storage requirement of the medication.  It is required to be shaken before using.  So these over the counter eye drops do feel like cool relief when applying.<br /><br />For our purpose of eye medication storage and convenience this Mini Fridge is almost perfect.,10/11/14

Maybe I should give this 5 stars, but honestly it's a water filter and the 5th star should be given by those that can tell the difference in the quality of what it actually filters out.  The technical data for the filter's quality is what I'm not giving the 5th star for as again, I'm not sure on how to rate that other than the water doesn't taste funny or anything unusual to the obvious senses.  Everything else seems perfect and I'd buy this again if available next time we need to replace the filter.  Thanks Waterfall Filter Company! :)",9/18/14

"GE Profile PHS920SFSS 30"" Profile Series Slide-in Electric Range with Smoothtop Cooktop, in Stainless Steel",5,Y,Best range ever.,"My wife loves this oven range. The cooking surfaces are arranged properly according to my wife.  Of course she got an all new induction compatible cookware set along with the range since none of her existing cookware passed the magnet test.<br /><br />We have had it 6 months and there is nothing not to like.  The controls are simple and easy to clean.  If the slight hum at the highest cooking levels bothers anyone, they are altogether too fussy.  It's barely audible.  This unit will boil water so fast it's unbelievable and you can lay your finger on the range top right next to the cooking utensil and its barely warm with the water boiling away.  Its so easy to clean.  Induction cooking is every bit as good as gas for responsiveness with none of the drawbacks of gas (cleaning etc)<br /><br />The convection oven is the best she has ever used she just did a beef roast using the probe and the roast came out perfectly.<br /><br />We have not used the warming drawer yet but will this Thanksgiving.<br /><br />Slipping the oven shelves in and out is quite easy.  You must be careful to insert them exactly as shown using a high angle to start.  They NEVER require force so if doesn't easily slide in effortlessly then stop; do not force it - you are doing it wrong.",9/14/14

The flame is very hot and heats very fast .I installed this cooktop myself replacing a ten year old cooktop .Only  thing is that on the electric plug the ground prong was bent very bad but not broken  Also the surface had a few scratches on it but with the grates they don't show up till you remove them  Also on the GE web site GE say stainless steel cleaner comes with this cooktop but in this unit it was also missing So maybe this is a scratch and dent outfit .but all in all this is a great product easy to install and to change  to propane gas. the lock makes a very loud noise when in the lock position if the burner is turned on. This was a good buy and I would buy this cooktop again..the 4 stars instead of five that I gave this cooktop was for the couple of scratches on the stainless steel and the bent plug.   The big central burner cooks a big pot of chili very fast brings the pot to a boil very fast.   My wife loves it and she the cook so that all that counts. I try to be very honesty about my reviews .

"GE PGS950SEFSS Profile 30"" Stainless Steel Gas Slide-In Sealed Burner Double Oven Range - Convection",5,Y,Love this range,"After reading the reviews that perhaps the center burner might not get too hot, we purchased this range because the controls were on the front and not on the back.  We love it!  Center burner?  Cooks awesome once I realized I'm supposed to remove the grate and put the griddle between the 2 side grates ... go figure.  Also,  our installer explained our 1970's home had a 3/8&#34; gas line when the stove was really designed for a 1/2&#34; line (I think that's right) and the heat quality with all 4 burners + the center burner when all were on might be diminished.  So far we haven't used everything at once and it would be rare if we did.  We love the super burner -- heats whatever  we are cooking quickly, and then simmers to perfection.<br /><br />The top oven is regular gas and not convection;  the lower can cook either convection or gas;  we wish the top was dual option too... we love both ovens -- the center rack on the bottom has bearings or something that makes it roll out easily.  We love that.<br /><br />The range is a slide in, but the top overlaps the counter so spills won't link down between the range and cabinet.  We love that, too<br /><br />We would definitely recommend this range.",9/10/14
"GE Cafe CGP650SETSS 36"" Built-In Gas Cooktop",5,Y,As Functional as it is Attractive,"This is the first higher-end stove I have owned, and it is worth it. The design of the unit is just as attractive as the photo, which is what caught my eye when I first began looking for a range. Having four different BTU burners -- two normal, one small, one large and one huge, is quite convenient. I can also understand how expert cooks could maximize use of these features. The stove also cleans easily with a dishsoap-laden sponge.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The wrong grill was included in the box, but when I called GE they sent the correct one immediately.<br /><br />The mounting brackets are pathetic if you have a hole that is larger than the specifications for this unit. Such an installation requires securing the range so it won't move around. I had to precisely place the range because if the hole had been an 1/8&#34; larger in any direction, it would have been visible from above. I purchased basic steel 1 1/4 X 5 &#34; tie plates, bent and drilled them, and then attached them to holes I carefully drilled in the thin bottom of the range. It worked perfectly. (BTW the holes the manual claims are present in the side of the range for mounting are not there.)<br /><br />Even with these problems, which are way too common nowadays, the range deserves five stars.",9/9/14

This arrived on time and in perfect condition. The price and brand were big sellers...I was on a budget and was replacing a GE Profile. The contractor I hired had this installed in two hours.  It looks great but a few things I would change:<br /><br />&#62; make the color of the elements stand out more from the background.  It can be difficult to tell where the heating &#34;eye&#34; is and isn't.<br />&#62; make the large element able to be used on smaller pots.  The other elements are more flexible, but the large element only works on the largest pan I could find.  Otherwise, it won't recognize the pot is there and turns off.<br />&#62; on that note, get rid of the pan detection function.  If I want to put a tiny pan on an eye, or no pan at all, and turn the thing up as high as it will go, I should be able to do it.  This functionality makes no sense, just limits me.<br />&#62; I'm on the fence on the controls.  They look nice and are super easy to clean being flush with the cooktop.  However, they are super irritating to use.  You have to tap the buttons *just so* at *just* the right pace using *just* the right amount of your finger for them to work.  Half the time you save switching from electric to induction gets eaten up just trying to get the stupid &#34;eye&#34; to turn on.<br /><br />I think I am still getting used to the unit (it's been 2 weeks) but as an avid cook, I can't say I love it.",9/4/14

"GE Cafe CGP650SETSS 36"" Built-In Gas Cooktop",4,Y,I LOVE THIS STOVE- mostly...edited 1/10/16,"I LOVE THIS STOVE.  I have had it for about 6 months and I love it.  I wanted to wait to write about it until I had put it to the test.  I didn't buy it as a kitchen trophy, although I do enjoy the many compliments it has gotten.  I cook.  A lot.  I reheat, boil, fry, braise, sear, steam...  I just canned peaches on this stove using the hot bath method on the BIG burner.  I have also used the big burner for corn on the cob, crab legs and pasta.  It is great for those times you have large amounts of water you don't want to wait eons for.  Enough of the center burner.  On to the griddle that comes with it.  My family mocks me on how much I use the griddle.  This weekend I made french toast on the griddle while I sauteed apples to top.  It fit 4 large pieces of vienna bread perfectly.  I have also made great fajitas on it - there is spatter clean-up, but it really sears so well.  With the 3 other burners, I have yet to take the griddle off.  The grates clean up well and the stainless wipes up beautifully.  Do beware that when you wipe around the burners to make sure the tops are sitting securely.  If you bump it off kilter, it won't light, but gas will flow. The grates are heavy and awkward, but that is the reality of what they are and part of the positives as well.  After 6 months of pretty solid use in many different manners, I would have no issues recommending it.<br /><br />Soooo, I still love my stove.  Unfortunately I have to knock it down a star.  One of my nobs broke about 6 months ago.  It was the lock knob which I bumped while cleaning. I know the knobs are cheap, but I did bump it. Last Tuesday another one broke.  My sweetie tried to fix it with epoxy,  but it didn't hold.  It is pretty frustrating. The replacement knobs aren't cheap. But then again neither was the stove.  Plastic knobs.  GE. Shame on you.  You know better.",9/3/14

Installation was easy, but the opening in my counter had to be slightly enlarged about 1/4&#34; to accomodate its more rectangular shape then the older model.<br />The burners light easily.  The center burner has high BTU to help boil water faster or heat up a frying pan quickly.  The burner parts come apart easily, and go back together efficiently for cleaning.  The Burner Lock feature works well to child proof the cooktop.  It's nice having an all new cooktop with no rust.  The cooking grates feel heavy, and are dishwasher safe.",9/2/14

They put me through to the manufacturer and GE made me a service call appointment for a week later. Hopefully they can fix it.

Not sure how the real filtering specs line up against the GE brand and whether the posted values are accurate, but the water quality where I live is quite good, so I am not overly concerned. The value is hard to beat.  I have received email follow up directly from the company including installation instructions, so there is effort on the customer service side to ensure satisfaction.

Contacted seller with no response. I needed a microwave so I didn't return the item. It is overpriced, but I was desperate because my old microwave stopped working. I gave it 3 stars because I think this is a refurbished item that shouldn't be claimed as new. Also, the handle is made of plastic, not stainless steel as it appears to be. The Tape (made to look like stainless steel), keeps peeling from the heat of the range, and exposing the plastic more everyday. I have had this microwave for 8 months now, and half of the tape wrapped around the plastic handle is gone. It is functional, but looks really tacky.",8/19/14

When you call that number they say &#34;oh No, we don't replace we'll send a repairman out&#34; how about you wait from 12-6 on a Saturday.

"GE PGS950SEFSS Profile 30"" Stainless Steel Gas Slide-In Sealed Burner Double Oven Range - Convection",5,Y,Enjoy the look with some minor issues...,"First review in some time, but I know all are leery of doing a purchase this big online.<br /><br />I am very happy with the look of the range and the packaging for safety of the materials was perfect and extreme, not simply just in a shipping box.  This range if not actually looked at in store, which should be done, has an overlap on range top so that food can not fall in the gap between the stove and cabinets.  Since this is a 1/2 inch overlap on each side make sure measurements and height of counter are considered.  The leveling legs have about a 2 inch rise MAX... and be careful when extended this high things get wobbly and legs may bend if not on perfectly smooth floor and leg catches on sliding in.<br /><br />So that would be my first negative, week leveling leg brackets.  The second and last negative is that I had read in past where this range arrived dead on arrival.... I had a similar issue, plugged in and nothing, no power.  I then looked at the line cord for the range, it is not hard wired, and as such found the plug on end of line cord had one wire out three not secured / push looked into the connector.  I had to call GE for a tech to be dispatched (1 week), but begged her to have tech have part in hand and not simply come out to look and not resolve since delay was 1 week.  I the meantime I was able to push the loose wire into the back via the connector to make good connection till correctly repaired and not loose.  So this may explain a dead on arrival / no power.  Quality control on the line cord...<br /><br />But besides that love the look all seems to work fine with burners.  Have not used oven convection but that will next.<br /><br />I went to a big box store, did measurements and made sure I liked the look then the price search was on.  I was able to get this range 500 dollars cheaper plus the no tax savings.  I expected that the shipping, free in my case per say, would take a few weeks and it took 1 week to go coast to coast and then 1 week to get from shipper to house.et from shipper to house.",7/25/14

It still got scratches. It is easy to wipe down due to the lack of knobs but it streaks horribly with normal cleaning. If you use the product that is included for cleaning it does a good job of polishing it. We kinda of gave up on trying to keep it looking like it did out of the box, after all it is a tool for cooking. Bottom Line: We like how it heats and cooks. Hint: keep a single edge razor handy for scraping baked on hardened spills...    The rating has dropped to 3 stars. The cooktop has started to malfunction. It quit once.

My only (minor) complaint is that the griddle does not heat evenly,  The stainless steel is extremely easy to clean, which I absolutely love - my old GE cooktop was black glass, which didn't stay clean for more than 5 seconds, and was a bear to clean.  On to the customer service comment - I had heard some negative reviews about GE service, but when one of my knobs broke, I called them and in less than 5 minutes, I had a replacement on the way.  Thank you to all previous reviewers - when I was looking at a range of cooktops, your reviews (and Consumer Reports) helped me make up my mind.  It is a great cooktop at a great price.",6/30/14

Not so easy!  Well sure enough Amazon price is almost as good as it gets, but the free shipping makes it a reasonable deal (for  a manufacturer's overpriced part)  Came very quickly, impossible to tell apart as it is an orignal replcement part fil right in and one could only tell the difference in that the replacements are less worn",6/26/14
GE Part Number WB24T10026 INF SWITCH CONTROL (2000W),5,Y,Exactly what I needed,"Somehow, someway, a whole lot of chicken broth spilled on my stove. No comment. Some of it managed to drip behind the front panel, there was an electric burning smell, and one of the burners stopped working. I can only imagine how expensive it would have been to call someone out to look at it. So I turned to my old friend Google.<br /><br />Cut power to stove. Removed the stove knobs, exposing the bolts underneath that held the plate on. Removed those, which allowed the front plate cover to slide off. And there they were, the four switch controls for each of the individual burners. Simple troubleshooting determined that some of the broth had gotten inside one of those switch controls. I confirmed this by simply swapping two of them around, and look at that! Now it's a different burner that doesn't work.<br /><br />So I ordered this switch control for amazon, after confirming the model number printed on the one that was bad. It was deceptively easy to replace. Just a little screw holding it down and some wires that snapped into it. If you take the wires off one at a time and snap them into the corresponding slot on the new switch control, it's super easy and you don't have to take a bunch of pics of where all the wires go. After all the wires are moved over (I think there were about six of them) you just put the new switch control in place, reattach the screw that holds it, replace the front cover panel and the knobs. All the burners are back in action, and everybody is happy.",6/26/14
"GE PP989DNBB Profile 30"" Black Electric Smoothtop Cooktop - Downdraft",4,Y,Great but hard to clean.,"This stove top looks beautiful and heats up quickly.  I love the griddle option where two of the left burners can combine to make one long heated area great for a pancake griddle.  It arrived in two days and the price was $40 less than anything else I could find on line, or by calling various appliance shops.  With Amazon Prime, I paid zero for shipping!  My only issue with it is that it's very difficult to get a streak free clean on the glass.  The knobs are tricky to get around to clean as well.  This cook top is on an island in the middle of my kitchen so it's sort of a focal point.  I guess I'm obsessed with it staying perfectly clean.  The best solution so far has been a squirt bottle filled 3/4 with water and 1/4 white vinegar.  I added a little squirt of dish soap as well.  Spraying this on it and wiping down with dry paper towels has worked best.  The cleaner they give you with the stove just ended up in a big streaky mess.  I'm regretting that I did not buy the version without knobs.  The fan is a bit loud on high, but not bad at the lower speeds.",6/25/14

All my food ended up getting defrosted and had to move back into my original freezer. I called GE service. Someone came out and told me that the pressure chamber was damaged. So he had to order another and replace it. The service person said that it will be covered under the warranty. But having to replace a part, waiting another week for that to happen is not my idea of buying a new one. The only reason why I gave two star was that this was covered under warranty.

"GE Cafe CGP650SETSS 36"" Built-In Gas Cooktop",5,Y,Best Cooktop I've Ever Purchased - Propane Conversion Issue,So this is by far the best cooktop I've used. In order to convert it to propane make sure you not only convert the jets from the natural gas to the propane jets provided BUT ALSO open the regulator valve and flip the plastic piece inside upside down from where it was originally at. At first I didn't do this and the heat output was less than my electric was before it. I was pretty disappointed but after &#34;reading the instructions...&#34; (I'm a guy what can I say?) I found the error in my ways and it works better than ever. One other very important thing to do is to adjust the jets by removing the knobs - big problem is how far down the valve adjustment is so I ended up buying this screwdriver set as well: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000T9UET4 in order to adjust them. Highly recommended stovetop.,6/17/14

Thumb screws lock in some anchors, and it's done.<br />Heat is nearly instant (water comes to a boil in 1-2 minutes for me), and the controls are about as simple as they can be.

Water dispenser inside fridge which saves space and ensures that the front cannot be defaced by water dispensing activities.<br />2. Great look and feel comparable to top-notch fridges.<br />3. Has an ice maker (which I personally don't use). For this price point, this is a great value.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Water dispensing button is very hard to press (what the heck). Would be nice if they could replace the button with a more high-quality one (which should not cost much). It looks ok.<br />2. Non-ergonomic design for water dispensing activity (you have to stand in an awkward position to get water).<br /><br />Overall a good buy but definitely not a 5-star fridge. Well worth the money.

"GE JVM3160RFSS 30"" Over-the-Range Microwave Oven in Stainless Steel",5,Y,"Stylish, convenient","I got this to replace a 3-year old GE microwave that went kaput. The old one wasn't under warranty anymore and it cost over $100 just to get a technician out here, so we decided to invest in a new one. I'm very happy with this microwave. It offers the same sleek design that the older one did, matches well with my other stainless steel appliances. It has every standard microwave feature we've all come to expect. My only gripe is that the popcorn button (which I use all too frequently) makes you choose the size of the popcorn bag--there are 3 options. Kind of annoying when you're used to just pushing popcorn and having it start--now, I have to press it twice (to select the middle size, because frankly I have no idea how big my bags are and of course they're not listed in ounces on the bag) and then also to hit start. Very minor but still, kind of annoying.<br /><br />Installation was not as easy as the manual makes it sound--it took me and my husband a while to get it, and one of the screws kept falling through the actual microwave, so we had to take it down, shake it upside down, etc. I think we ended up using 3 of the 4 screws and just hoping it would hold, because it was such a process to install. But I guess that'd be any microwave that you have to hold up while installing!<br /><br />Overall, this is a great product. I trust GE products and this is a great microwave.",6/8/14

The shorter lens is available from several suppliers for about $60 !!  I took another gamble to cut the too-long lens down to 3 5/8&#34; length - it did not survive!

GE GTUP240GMWW Spacemaker 6.6 Cu. Ft. White Gas Washer/Dryer Combo,1,Y,Worst company to buy from - doesn't live up to Amazon standards,"HCcost delivered our washer/dryer a month ago. We are under construction, so it took a while before we could install. A few days ago we finally got a plumber to install the product -- only to find out that it  was damaged (most likely in transit). Huge dent on the top of the unit. I emailed Amazon and HCcost immediately to ask for a replacement because the dryer drum was scraping against the dent. The item cannot be repaired because the dent is too extensive. Evidently, we are 3 days past their return policy. This is the worst customer satisfaction policy ever. What kind f a company is this? And, why does Amazon parter with someone that makes them look bad? We have been renovating our whole house, and have gotten much of it from Amazon. This is the only time we have been disappointed. Now I'm stuck with a piece of junk in my garage. My only hope is AmEx. At least AmEx stands up for the customer. Please resolve this issue. We have been great customers, but this may change our minds about who to shop with. HCcost has no idea about CXM. The experience is everything. And this experience is terrible.",6/3/14

"GE C2S985SETSS Cafe 30"" Stainless Steel Dual Fuel (Gas) Sealed Burner Range - Convection",4,Y,It is so beautiful,"I like this range, although like any stainless steel range, it requires special cleaning attention. One of the things that attracted me to buy it was the center griddle.  It really is fun to cook bacon and pancakes on the griddle.  I also thought having two ovens would come in handy sometimes, and this model has the small oven at the bottom, unlike the one I looked at in the store that had the large oven on the bottom -- much easier to pull a big turkey out of the oven.  But, the lower oven is better as a warming drawer than a true oven.  I have cooked in the lower oven, but the results are better in the large oven. One thing that baffles me is why they put the large burners in the front -- seems like you'd want the tall pots in the back.  I've used it a lot, and so far, no problems.",5/27/14

It is easy to clean and has a nice blue light that warns you a burner is still on. The grills are like restaurant stove types and the extra cast iron cooking surface that goes in place of the left grill is a nice plus. Makes good pancakes.

I pushed something up into the dispenser tube in the door and two small pieces of white plastic came out and I got water again for a while until it stopped altogether again a few months later.  The dispenser line was clear and I narrowed it down to the filter assembly.  I think maybe the shutoff valve that is supposed to be disabled by screwing in the filter or cap broke (probably the source of the plastic).  Replacing the filter assembly fixed it and now we have strong water dispensing again.,5/16/14

GE PVM9179SFSS Profile 1.7 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Over-the-Range Microwave - Convection,1,Y,Damaged,"The microwave came damaged. The packaging was very odd. It was in a box in a box. The box it was boxed in was far too bulky and was packaged with empty UPS boxes which didn't protect it from the damage. If it had been sent without being boxed it probably would have fared better since the box it was in originally would have been less bulky to carry and probably wouldn't have been dropped as it appears to have been. The empty boxes it was packed with were utterly useless. If it was packaged with normal styrofoam like most packages it wouldn't have damaged the item. Penny wise, pound foolish perhaps. I will say they responded promptly to the return and that was handled very well. I'm a little concerned about ordering another from them. One of the other raters said that three of theirs were sent damaged and I'd hate to have to waste the time and energy again. The package also didn't indicate that it should be handled with care, breakable or fragile, so Mr. or Mrs UPS wouldn't have known to treat it with care.",5/9/14

My kitchen cabinets were customed made in 2007 for this popular style of microwave over cooktop but my first very good microwave started with problems 4 years later progressing to less functions in 2012 and completely stopped in 2013.  Repairman confirmed what I saw as a problem with so much steam from alot of activity on cooktop getting into the electrical works of microwave.  Now with my new gas top, I had to adapt counter to raise it 3/4&#34; and then another good inch or so for height of grates...so now even closer to microwave.  But since my cabinets were built for this type of installation I'm stuck as not enough counterspace to have a separate microwave (which by the way I can buy a comparable one of those for so much less cost).",4/29/14

The dryer is still going strong so I wanted to replace but the bulb had been selling for something like $6.99, which seemed a lot for a lightbulb.  But I figured for another 8 years it would probably outlast the dryer, so I bought one.  The bulb fit the socket correctly and worked just fine, but after about 4 months it burned out.  I hadn't planned to replace it, but at this price it's too cheap not to try again.  Maybe this will last 8 years at the cheaper price?  I'm buying 2.  If I go through both before the dryer gives up, I'm won't bother replacing again.",4/27/14

"GE PGS950SEFSS Profile 30"" Stainless Steel Gas Slide-In Sealed Burner Double Oven Range - Convection",5,Y,Very well made.,"This is the only double oven I found in a slide in gas range configuration. I really wanted the ability to have a double oven in our kitchen, as we enjoy hosting gatherings and it seems there was never enough space. In addition we also bought the convection microwave that matches and it also can serve as a small third oven.<br /><br />First impressions are that this is a well made oven. Heavy duty grates, includes a very nice griddle for the center burner, heavy powder coated interior components. Lower oven has a well made gliding shelf to make things easier to work with.<br /><br />Only thing to note is that the lower oven is very low from what you are used to. The upper oven is pretty small height wise, but you should still get two large casserole dishes in side by side if need be. This is actually nice for most of the things I cook on a regular basis, and I don't see myself using the lower oven except for larger events.<br /><br />You can feed a small army with this oven.",4/18/14

Just a 30 seconds more button I forget is there. You have to push time cook then 2:00. And it is a lesser 700 watts. I usually adjust the cooking time, and everything turns out well. Even those pot pies that say you must have at least 1000 watts brown up nicely in their special packaging.<br /><br />The small size is good, and the black and steel look is more appealing to me than white.

Please note:  I haven't used the bottom oven but the upper oven more than adequately meets my current needs.  It should be noted however that is difficut to pull-out the lower rack (on the upper oven) when set at the lowest  point without running the risk of burning your knuckles on the oven door.  Unlike the bottom oven that has an extension rack that slides, this feature is not offered for the upper oven.<br /><br />On this model the bake/heating element is under the oven floor. Manufacturer's recommendation is that  &#34;grease all oven rack side edges with a light coating of vegetable oil after cleaning them by hand or in the oven to maintain the ease of sliding in out the oven.<br /><br />Also, note you should be sure you have the right pans for the cooktop and oven for radiant glass cooktop.  Stainless steel, aluminum and copper bottom is recommended (porcelain enamel on cast iron only recommend if bottom of pan is coated).  Not recommended - porcelain enal on steel, glass-ceramic, stoneware and cast-iron ubless specifically for glass cooktops.

Of course to replace the handle you have to take the door apart which involved us breaking a few plastic tabs - but it went back together ok so hopefully it will last a few more years before we buy another microwave.  Regardless, you'd think that a company as large as GE would run stress tests on components that are in direct use day in and day out and address the poor design(s) in their products.  (I say this because based on google results it appears that the handle breaking on this microwave is a VERY common problem).  I guess we can only dream of quality appliances!",3/23/14

"GE PHB925STSS Profile 30"" Stainless Steel Electric Induction Range - Convection",1,Y,Consider all other options before buying this product,"I'll first justify my rating here, before giving a detailed account of our ordeal.<br />- One star removed for GE being a company that treats its customers badly<br />- One star removed for Induction Range not being widely used in the US. (See ramifications below.)<br />- Two stars removed for this being a relatively higher end model of GE Induction Range. (Again, see ramifications below.)<br /><br />The following is a simplified outline of events. Most phone calls were not fruitful and therefore not mentioned here.<br /><br />We bought this range in early Nov. 2013, and it was delivered in late Nov. It broke down in less than a month. In the sense that it was totally dead. When we contacted the seller for returns, we were told that happy for us, the range was covered by GE's warranty. In other words, we couldn't.<br /><br />We contacted GE for repairs. The first time slot a repair person was available was in three days. When the repairman came, he read the code on the range, and went to his van to check. Eventually he came back with bad news: not only he didn't have the part needed, it was on back order until January. He said that we'd be offered a replacement unit. But we had to call their 800 number ourselves.<br /><br />It took another day for GE to &#34;research&#34; the case, in which time they verified that the part needed for repair was indeed not available, and the back order would be filled no earlier than mid-January. They offered us a replacement unit with a different model number. While on the phone, we did a quick research, and found that the replacement model was not available on Amazon, and on GE's website it was listed for $700 less than the model we bought. We asked for compensation of the price difference, and were told by the agent that day (Kaitlin) that she could only arrange for the replacement, and we had to wait until the agent whom dealt with our case first (Angela) to discuss monetary compensation. Considering that without the replacement we were set to go through the Christmas season without a working range, we agreed to have the replacement.<br /><br />The replacement came in less than a week (i.e., we were without a range for more than 10 days total) and worked fine since then. We liked the fact that it heats very quickly. We didn't like the fact that we had to replace all our cookware, but are resigned to it.<br /><br />Because the price we paid on Amazon Marketplace was less than the list price on GE's website, we also tried to find the unit on the Internet. It was available for about $700 less than what we paid for this unit.<br /><br />In January, 2014, when we were in contact with Angela, she told us that GE guideline was that a replacement unit only has to be functionally equivalent; no monetary compensation was given. When we protested, she (yes, Angela herself) reviewed the case and found it totally satisfactory. She even sent us a letter to that effect.<br /><br />In February, we complained through NYS AG's office. A different woman, Kelly J------, took the case. After some days of research, she came up with an offer of $200, plus a one-year extended warranty. I did not think the offer fair, and rejected it.<br /><br />In March, we complained through BBB Kentucky. Again, Kelly J------ got the case, and replied that she made the offer of $200 plus one year extended warranty, which I rejected.<br /><br />So now let me briefly explain my rationale for the rating:<br />- GE treated us badly. You could judge that from the fact above. I do not have experience with other brands because of the no-return policy, but I couldn't imagine another company treating their customers worse than this.<br />- Induction Range might be more troublesome to repair than other ranges, due to its unpopularity. The repairman came with a van full of parts and tools, and yet the parts needed to repair our range was not on it. Or anywhere in this country, for that matter. My guess is that the van did contain parts forrepairing other, more popular, types of ranges.<br />- Lastly, if you had to get a GE appliance of any kind, get the cheapest one you could find! Our experience suggests that for economic reasons GE would only provide replacement units of like functionality but of the cheapest price.repairing other, more popular, types of ranges.<br />- Lastly, if you had to get a GE appliance of any kind, get the cheapest one you could find!

GE PYE23PSDSS Profile 23.1 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Counter Depth French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,1,Y,Would give this beautiful refrigerator -5 if I could-I am so disappointed in GE,"Purchased this refrigerator on Christmas Day, not my choice of a present but a necessity.  It was delivered on 1-6-14.  Had it 2 months and had to throw all my food in the trash due to problems that the repairman couldn't find.  My first warning of trouble was constant running around the clock of the compressor (which did get hot-fire hazard?).  Called GE. I was told to unplug it for about a minute, then plug it in again (to set the sensors) - didn't work.  Called GE again.  Appointment for a repairman to come out was made.  Repairman never showed up because he just works on commercial refrigeration, not residential.  No one bothered to call to set another appointment.  Called GE again.  This repairman did show up, worked on it for 2 hours and ran all the diagnostics with no problem showing up.  Was told to wait 24 hours to see if it would fix itself - it didn't.  Called GE again.  Now it's Friday afternoon, and of course no one works on the weekend.  I was told I'd have to wait 24-48 hours to find out what would be done next.  I didn't realize the temperature in both freezer and refrigerator were dropping to an unsafe level. So, I lost several hundred dollars worth of food.  My goal is to get this appliance out of my home, don't want the same model replacement, and at this point don't want another GE.  The funny thing is I've had GE appliances during the last 55 years of marriage and never had a problem.  I think this model needs to be recalled.  The next one  I pick will be plain, no fancy ice making or water in the door.  Just more to break down.  When I hear what will happen next, I will post it.  Hopefully it will be good news.",3/16/14

Since this company makes filters to  provided specifications, I decided to try it.  The received filter is thinner than the original and it came with a metal frame around the entire filter, not just on the long sides as shown in the photo.  I was able to modify it by cutting a piece out of the<br />middle of the short sides of the frame.  I was therefore able to bend the filter to enable it to be inserted into the holder.

"GE PP975BMBB Profile 36"" Black Electric Smoothtop Cooktop",4,Y,Beautiful appliance,"This is my second GE Profile electric cooktop.  My first one lasted ten years until I dropped something on it and the corner cracked.  Then one of the burners died, so I decided to update and purchase a new one.  First of all, it fit easily and perfectly in the old cut in my island's granite.  It is sleek, and very easy to keep clean.  There are some new features compared to the old model, such as a very large burner with three different size rings as well as a quick boil burner which I love.  It is a considerably faster boil using this coil.  Based on this, I have given the stovetop a four star rating, and overall, I am quite pleased.  I considered a five star review but decided that I truly missed having a timer on the cooktop, a change from the old model.  No timer.  I had to buy a separate kitchen timer, but I still miss having a handy one right on the cooktop.  There are many times that one kitchen timer on my oven is just not enough.<br />Then there was the problem with the delivery of the new cooktop.  Delivery was timely, but after installation, I discovered that a coil on the brand new cooktop did not work at all.  There were several phone calls to GE and I tried their suggestions to no avail.  Obviously a defective coil in an expensive brand new appliance.  So back it went to Amazon who stood by their guarantee.  I got a full refund plus all shipping except about $10.  But it was a fairly complicated process that involved several lengthy phone calls to Amazon.  In the end, I am happy with Amazon as usual, just not sure if I would buy a major appliance through them again.  I did save nearly $250 compared to local big box retailers, so I cannot complain.",3/15/14

"GE Cafe CGS990SETSS 30"" Freestanding Gas Range with 5 Sealed Burners, Convection Self-Clean Double Oven and Griddle, in Stainless Steel",4,Y,Excellent range,"To give you a perspective of where I'm coming from, I previously had a 48\\"", 8 burner, double oven Viking range. After moving, I only had room for a 30\\"" range.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Looks good,  This is a freestanding range, not a slide in, but it doesn't have a back piece that sticks up.  I hate the way those look.  You also have to reach over hot burners to get to the controls on most ranges that have the back piece. This is the only range with 2 ovens that is like this except for the Electrolux which is dual fuel and requires a 220 line.  The top of the stove (under the burners) is stainless also. On most ranges it is black even if the front is stainless.<br /><br />-Huge amount of oven space for 30\\"".  It has more than my 48\\"" Viking had.<br /><br />-Lower oven preheats to 350 in 8 minutes, which is pretty fast.<br /><br />-2 powerful burners.  They are higher BTUs than the Viking burners. The left front power burner can also can go down very low- almost like a candle for anything very delicate.<br /><br />-Electronics. Most ranges have most of these, but the \\""professional\\"" ranges like Viking do not.  This includes timer, temperature probe cooking, delayed start, etc.<br /><br />-Lower oven has an electric element on the ceiling to produce more even heat than just the gas burner on the floor.  Not sure how this affects usage costs (electric costs more than gas almost everywhere in US for ovens).  It is not 220, so maybe the draw isn't than much.<br /><br />-Self cleaning.  Yes, even cheap ranges are self cleaning now, but some professional are not. My Viking wasn't.<br /><br />-Ball bearing rack. It moves very smoothly.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-There is only 1 ball bearing rack in the lower oven. The other 2 (1 in upper, 1 in lower) are standard racks. For this price of stove, it would have been nice for them all to be ball bearing.<br /><br />-The middle oval burner is not very powerful.  It works fine with the included griddle for pancakes, etc., but you can't generate enough heat for many things.  If I put my cast iron grill/griddle over it (after replacing the griddle with the grate included), it doesn't get hot enough to do a good sear.  Griddle is non-stick and will wear out in time.  I use the grate instead of the griddle. It looks better and gives you a place to move hot pots/pans.<br /><br />-The lower oven is low to the ground. If you use the upper rack, it is fine. If you use the lower, it is awkwardly low. I try and use the upper oven and middle lower oven racks mainly, so not a big issue.  If you are old, have back problems, etc., take into account that the bottom of the lower oven is almost at the floor.<br /><br />-The upper oven can handle pizzas, casseroles, veggies, etc.  You can't put anything more than probably 6 inches high.  You can't roast a whole chicken.  I think for most people, that is not a problem as you have the lower oven which is pretty big.  Use the upper for sides, keeping food warm, etc. The broiler is in the upper oven also.<br /><br />-I wouldn't have minded another power burner. The 2 back burners are pretty low output.  I guess 2 powerful burners is pretty good.<br /><br />Other notes:<br /><br />-The noise from the fan is nothing. Those that complained have super hearing or a defective stove.  It is more quiet than my Bosch dishwasher.<br /><br />-If you like to bake bread, use the lower convection oven. Do your final rise of the dough in the upper oven which will be warm, but not hot from the preheating of the lower oven.ou can't generate enough heat for many things.  If I put my cast iron grill/griddle over it (after replacing the griddle with the grate included), it doesn't get hot enough to do a good sear.  Griddle is non-stick and will wear out in time.  I use the grate instead of the griddle. It looks better and gives you a place to move hot pots/pans.<br /><br />-The lower oven is low to the ground. If you use the upper rack, it is fine. If you use the lower, it is awkwardly low. I try and use the upper oven and middle lower oven racks mainly, so not a big issue.

I replaced an older GE cooktop which required a slightly larger cut out, but it went in great without the extra frame kit. (I angled the screws into the countertop and it's tight.) I'm a single mom and my daughter and I took out the old cook top and put in the new one in about 45 minutes. The cook top is designed to be easy to tell which burner your turning on/off and the &#34;on&#34; light is bright enough.  I did my research and found that the coil top is by far the easiest to keep clean and if you don't like the looks of the coil, get four Corell burner covers which come in white/SS/artistic patterns, etc.  The ceramic/glass cooktops are pretty, but not functional.  I would definitely recommend this cooktop if you are looking for great variable heating, control, looks and ease of use.",3/12/14

We have had it about six weeks, and so far, we LOVE it.  The variability of cooking levels is  much better than our (good quality) electric cooktop and the instant heat is remarkable.  We live in Arizona, so the idea of less heat in the house during the long summer season is very appealing as well.  I (almost) look forward to cooking, as it functions so well.<br /><br />If there are any negatives to consider, it would be that it is a little hard to see where the actual &#34;burners&#34; are and that we are still trying to figure out how to keep the surface as shiny and pretty as we would like.",3/6/14

GE Profile CleanDesign PP912BMBB 30 Smoothtop Electric Cooktop - Black,5,Y,Love my Profile Cooktop!,"I previously had a GE Profile smooth top electric cooktop for more than 14 years.

Recently another burner was not working properly and since the cook top was marred by years of heavy use, I decided to get a new one.  I got the Profile model because while it was more money, the warranty was longer than the similar non Profile model and I thought it was a better value with the warranty.  They are very similar, but the Profile has a child lock included.  The new cooktop has better sized burners than my old GE Profile.  The burner sizes are in different places than the old one, and I like this new placement better.  I checked everywhere for the best price and Amazon beat everyone. I was amazed that the cooktop arrived 3 days after I ordered it.  It is very easily installed and unlike my old cooktop, this has a foam gasket around the edge so when I let something boil over, it does not run under the cooktop.",3/2/14

I was able to track by box the whole way.  Once delivered I had it installed and I've been cooking non stop.  My husband especially loves the grill that comes with it.  In fact we leave the grill on because it's a little on the heavy side and I usually don't cook with 5 burners.  The one thing I didn't realize is the grate height.  The grate height is about 3 inches from the base of the stove which is on the tall side.  It's a little awkward but we manage.  If the grate were 1 1/2 inches it would be perfect.  If you're not at least 5'7'' tall this might too tall for you. Otherwise best purchase to date!!!!  Thanks Amazon(-:,3/1/14

I have used Induction & Burner ceramic glass tops for 20 years with little to no cleaning problems. USE the recommended cleaner with the plastic sponge (or moist kitchen papper) & a razor if anything has spiled over, dry off with a Kitchen paper for a streak free finish & the shine will last you for years.<br />Tip2; if you are changing from a Drop in range to this Slide in like us you will need to cut the kitchen counter top (where it overhangs the unit as the unit is 30&#34; but the counter top hangs over by Aprox 1/4&#34; at each side & Aprox 2&#34; at the back) this was relatively easy as we don't have Granett yet & took an hour to fit.<br />Tip3; if your old unit leaves just wires coming our of your wall (I.e. no plug socket) it would be best to install one befor your new range Arives as the Range fitment is made for a plug in installation.<br />A great unit I would buy it again.",2/28/14

"GE Profile PHS920SFSS 30"" Profile Series Slide-in Electric Range with Smoothtop Cooktop, in Stainless Steel",5,Y,Researched for 6 months and chose to get the GE. Here are my thoughts.,"On GE's implementation of induction:<br /><br />Please read up on how induction works before buying an induction range. It's nothing like ordinary electric cooktops.<br /><br />- The induction range is amazingly fast and responsive. With a very thick, 7-ply Demeyere skillet (which normally takes a while to heat up even when empty), the medium-sized burner can boil 1cm water in under 10 seconds. When you turn the heat down, the response is nearly instantaneous -- even with the large heat capacity of this skillet, the water slows its boil in less than 3 seconds,  and that's on a smaller burner that does NOT have the &#34;power boil&#34; feature.<br />I read numbers like this when I was researching induction and they didn't impress me. Really you have to see it in action to realize how much time it saves.<br /><br />- I heard complaints about &#34;buzzing&#34; on GE's previous model of induction range. Some people even returned it for that reason. Here's the skinny:<br />&#62; When on low heat, below 5 1/2, the range &#34;clicks&#34; as it (presumably) turns on and off. The click is about as loud as lightly tapping a Bic pen against the counter. I don't find it distracting or annoying.<br />&#62; When on high heat, you can hear an &#34;electric&#34; sound. It doesn't sound much different to me than the sound I hear when I turn on high-powered standard electric cooktops, except that the electric cooktop is usually silent after a short time while the induction range keeps making the sound.<br />&#62; The sound itself isn't loud, and I wouldn't describe it as &#34;buzzing.&#34; What it sounds like is an electric transformer. I'm sure you've heard one before -- they are the giant grey cylinders on some power lines. You hear the same sound near high-tension power lines. It's exactly like that (in fact, the sound is probably coming from a transformer in the range), but it isn't as loud. I don't have sound measuring equipment, but i'd say that it's noticeable in the kitchen but not in the adjacent dining room except for when everything else is silent.<br /><br />- While arguably the greatest benefit of induction is that the range can vary temperature with even greater control than gas, this range does do the &#34;on/off&#34; switching at low settings (those below 5 1/2 out of 10). In practice, this hasn't reduced temperature or caused hot-spotting like it does on a electric glasstop, but it might when using very cheap, thin pans.<br /><br />- GE's range detects pan sizes and won't turn on if the pan is off the burner or is too small. This prevents accidentally heating a stainless steel wedding ring, for example, or a steel spatula. It also prevents you from using small pans on large burners, though this isn't a problem in practice... Except for the very large burner. We don't have any pans large enough for it to turn on. Not a problem though, the other burners work perfectly (Update: We now have a few pans large enough for the big burner and they heat up even faster than the other burners. According to the C-Net review, the large burner is the fastest-heating burner they have ever seen by quite a bit).<br /><br />- On changing pans: This was surprisingly cheap and easy for us. T-Fal has a whole set for under $99 (as if this writing) that works perfectly on induction. See http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWL8T4/<br />We have some &#34;nicer&#34; pans, like Demeyere, but they don't seem to work any better and cost a fortune (A single skillet, while clearly well made, cost three times more than the entire T-Fal set!).<br />You still want to do your homework on induction. If magnets do not stick to your pan's bottom, they probably won't work at all. The pan's bottom surface must made from one of: Most types of stainless steel, mild (ordinary) steel, or cast iron. Aluminum pans work only if the bottom is made from one of the above--all aluminum or all-copper pans do not work at all<br /><br />On the oven:<br /><br />- If you are worriedabout changing all your cook times with a new oven, note that you can adjust the thermostat of the GE to match your old range.<br /><br />- The racks don't seem to be especially well designed/manufactured, The slide-out rack was very difficult to fit into the oven, even with significant force, and scratched its sides a little. The other racks seem to be a little too wide as well and are difficult to pull out. They also make a rather unpleasant grinding sound as they slide along the oven walls.<br />(UPDATE December 2015: The racks have &#34;set&#34; and are now easy to slide in/out. The aforementioned scratches were not deep and did not penetrate the protective powder coating of the inside of the range).<br /><br />- The oven doesn't preheat especially quickly, but it does tell you its temperature in realtime as it heats.<br /><br />-  We haven't used it much at all and probably need more practice, but we did try cooking two pizzas at the same time with convection mode. The top pizza did not cook as much as the one on the bottom, though it did have slightly thicker toppings. Technically for 2 pizzas, we are suppose to position two racks equidistant from the center of the oven. We kept the 3-rack configuration because, as mentioned above, shifting racks is awkward.<br /><br />- The oven's window is larger than almost any oven's I've ever seen. It seems larger in person than the photo makes it look.<br /><br />- The oven light is near the door of the oven, so I guess it's easy to replace. I've never had to replace an oven light, though, so this is speculation.<br /><br />- The convection fan is audible but not loud, high-pitched, or distracting. It sounds more like white noise.<br /><br />On the controls:<br />- The entire control surface is capacitive touch glass, like on a smart phone. It works very well and rarely misses a tap. It is a little sensitive, though. When leaning over the oven (which admittedly is not done often), it sometimes thinks the &#34;set timer&#34; button has been pushed. The controls do have a lock-out feature to prevent this from happening and presumably to prevent kids from playing with it.<br /><br />- Range settings start at 5 of 10 when you turn them on. You then change the power with +/- buttons that shift the value by 1/2 with each press. Thus, it's slower to set the a burner to &#34;2&#34; than it is with old-style knobs. This problem is partly resolved by special buttons. One burner has a &#34;simmer&#34; button, which immediately sets power to 2. Another has a &#34;Melt&#34;, which sets it to 1. The large burner has a &#34;Power broil&#34; button, which presumably sets it above 10/10 for a time. (Update: It just sets it to 10/10)<br />In practice, changing settings is still pretty fast. The GE Monogram cooktop has a slide-to-set feature which I like even better, but it hasn't trickled down to the mid-range line.<br /><br />- Overall I am happy with the design of the controls. They feel intuitive, and give you hints as for what to do next. For example, when you set the timer and enter the time, the &#34;Set timer&#34; button blinks to remind you to tell the oven that you are ready to start the timer. There are many small touches like that which tell me that the GE engineers spend some time thinking about how to make their range easy to use.<br /><br />UPDATE: After two years, we have had zero problems with the unit. The glass surface still looks good, with only some very minor scratches.",2/18/14

"Genuine Aprilaire Humidifier Maintenance Kit 4839 - For Models 600, 600A, and 600M",5,Y,Saved me from replacing the entire humidifier,"I replaced the water panel every year since moving into a home with a Aprilaire model 600 installed. The first couple of years, relative humidity levels would stay constant around 30-35%, even on the coldest, dryest days of the year. This winter, however, relative humidity levels in my home have been as low as 23%, causing myriad problems: cracking and bleeding skin, bloody noses, and enough static to break one of our TV remotes when I picked it up from a microfiber couch!<br /><br />I bought this repair kit as a last resort; I was considering purchasing a new steam humidification system for a much higher price, but figured if this repair kit could get the humidifier back to a working state, I'd be happy with the $40 I spent.<br /><br />The kit came in a rather large, roomy box, and included every internal part of the humidifier; the frame, the water spreading tray, the hose, the drain hose adapter, and even an extra humidifer manual! Installation of all the new parts took maybe five minutes, and within a day, the relative humidity level was back up to 31%.<br /><br />So far, it's been a week since replacing the guts of my Aprilaire 600, and I'm very happy with the results (plus, I now have an extra frame I can clean out and swap in next winter if the need arises!

GE JVM1752DPBB 1.7 Cu. Ft. Black Over-the-Range Microwave,2,Y,I own this for 1 year and 9 months,"Cooks well and looks good but beware!!!

Keep in mind there are 8 of them.<br />Now you would think that they would send them free because how could they use plastic that melts in a microwave as the tray holders?<br />OK so I am forced to give in and pay $7.00 but before I did, I asked a simple question...How do you change this part? I couldn't see any way to do it.<br />After being put on hold 3 times the very friendly service person told me that the part in question could not be replaced by me.  It had to be done by a trained technician.  The cost of having a technician come is only $99.00 plus tax.<br />So to replace 1 plastic hook the total would be $106 plus tax!!<br />No thank you.<br />I will use 1 rack instead of 2 and buy a microwave from a reputable company next time!<br />If another hook melts that would make the cost to fix to plastic hooks more than the total cost of the microwave.

The number may contain a series of zeros in the middle of the set.  If you can't find a product match online, try searching for the part by removing one of those zeros from the model number.  In example, for model 123000456, you may try searching it as 12300456.<br /><br />This control board (WB27T11311 (T09 control board)) was used to replace the faulty one on a GE TrueTemp Range.  There are several older (obsolete) control board models that this replaces, those obsolete ones being #s WB27T11273, WB27T10816 and WB27T10467.<br /><br />There are several videos online that show how to replace the control board.  With only simple tools, it takes about fifteen minutes from start to finish.",1/22/14

GE GTUN275GMWW Spacemaker 9.3 Cu. Ft. White Gas Washer/Dryer Combo - Energy Star,4,Y,Excellent unit!,"We brought this to replace a five-year-old high-end Frigidaire unit with front-loading washer.  The Frigidaire had developed bearing problems in the washer drum (common to this model) and made a horrendous racket in spin cycle.  Frigidaire doesn't supply the bearings alone; one has to replace the entire drum assembly for around $500 including installation labor.  Additionally, the Frigidaire had very small capacity, especially in the washer.<br />The new GE unit overcomes both these problems; and in addition is very quiet while operating...much more so that our previous unit even before the bearing problems.  A few other reviews of this product complained about kit damaging clothes, but we haven't had this problem.  In fact, the only deficiency we've identified is that it lacks a buzzer or other signal that the dryer is finished.  If it had one we'd give it a maximum rating.<br /><br />Installation was very straightforward and took only about 45 minutes.<br /><br />We love it!",1/22/14
"GE PHP960SMSS Profile 36"" Stainless Steel Electric Induction Cooktop",5,Y,"ge profile 36"" induction cooktop","Amazing cooktop. Have this mounted in a 36&#34; Ikea Akurum base cabinet on a quartz countertop and this fits in a rectangular square. I wired this to a 50amp fuse using 6/2 wire as this only has 2 black wires and a ground. Using Costco- Kirkland stainless cookware which cooks amazing on this cooktop. The buzzing from this cooktop is almost non existent with this cookware.  Water boils in less than 2 minutes. Definitely use Barkeepers friend to keep the pots looking clean. Has a nice safe feature if the pan is off the cooktop rurns off, so unfortunately no flipping pancakes on this cooktop. Also has a cooktop lock. Cooktop is made from Schott Ceran glass. Pricey but worth it.  Followup 2/26/2014: Just wanted to note that larger pots do makes substantially more noise than smaller pots during boiling. Otherwise cooktop works great with no issues, ikea quartz counter top is now installed and hopefully will find time soon to install the backsplash. Followup 3/8/2015: Cooktop still working great as if it was the first day of use. Added another picture of page from instruction manual showing the need for a 50amp breaker. Enjoy",1/22/14

"GE PGP953SETSS Profile 30"" Stainless Steel Gas Sealed Burner Cooktop",2,Y,Beautiful but Valves Fail After a Couple of Years,"I'm actually reviewing the &#34;Cafe 30&#34; model since I had ordered the Profile and switched post-order, but I think they are identical except for the grating and possibly the grill accessory that comes with the Cafe.  (evVive Home did a really great job making the change and fulfilling the order.)  Really cool looking, backlit knobs, excellent ignition system, and I like showing off the power boil function to my sisters-in-law.  True, not at all a cheap option, but very heavy duty--the box weighs a ton, by the way, due in part to the heavy duty iron pieces.  Works great!  Update: Though I bought this product in 2012, it has only been in use since late 2013.  Initially I gave it very high marks.  But about 2 1/2 years of very light use, I'm having serious issues with the burner control knobs/valves.  One locked in the off position, so I just stopped using that burner.  But today a valve locked in the ON position and I couldn't shut off the burner, so I had to shut off the gas valve to the cooktop.  This is a serious defect and, of course, is no longer under warranty.  I'm going to see what can be done to fix this.  I'm sure the valves themselves have to be replaced.  Very disappointed with what I thought was a top-of-the-line product from a AAA manufacturer.",1/18/14
GE CZS25TSESS Cafe 24.6 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Counter Depth Side-By-Side Refrigerator,5,Y,A great product.,I struggled to find the largest counter depth refrigerator possible.  This one has met all of my expectations.  I especially like the LED lighting.  It makes the entire inside visible all the time.  I was skeptical after reading other buyers complaints but I am truly amazed at how wrong those comments were in regard to the item that was delivered to me.  The seller HCost deserves a big &#34;THANK YOU&#34;.  The purchase price and delivery were exceptional.,1/17/14
GE Microwave Oven Magnetron and Diode Kit OM75P (10) Part # WB27X10017,5,Y,Did the trick!,Made my 2005 Manufactured GE Spacemaker XL1800 work like new (man! there are a lot of different shells for the XL1800 depending on the year it was made!)! There was a small round diode-like item attached with 2-screws to the side of the original unit and not on the replacement. Simply moving this to the same location on the replacement and connecting things back up did the trick! I also replaced the small included diode that connects to the capacitor...why not? It was there.<br /><br />The whole deal took 2 1/2 hours start to finish - including remounting the unit above the range and going over to a neighbor (thanks neighbor!) to get help removing and remounting the microwave. Lots of videos on the web to help you along the way. Be patient and keep track of your screws!,1/16/14

General Electric GENERAL ELECTRIC WD28X10177 SILVERWARE BASKET,5,Y,Works Great,"Our dishwasher is a Whirlpool, not GE. But our old silverware basket was broken, so we measured it and found it was the same dimensions as this one. We ordered this one, and it fits perfectly. It is actually better than our old one because it is flat on the bottom, and can easily stand up on the counter while the kids put the silverware away. Our old one was slanted on the bottom, and even before it got broken, it was kind of a pain to use. The part I like best about this new basket is that the silverware can be separated into it's own individual slot, which I think is the reason why our silverware is coming out cleaner lately.",1/15/14
GE Freezer Door Gasket Seal WR24X445,5,Y,Perfect fit!,"The gasket came in a timely manner, and is well-made. The best way to install it it to take the door off and lay it flat - it is very easy to do, and it makes the removal and installation of the new gasket a quick and easy job. My freezer door has an ice / water dispenser in it, so I had to disconnect the water line, and that was quite simple. Also - place the new gasket in the tub with some warm water to cover it. This will loosen it up a bit to make installation easier, and also take out some of the &#34;shipping kinks&#34;.<br />I advise you to look at YouTube. There are several very good videos on the installation process worth the time to watch before doing the job. I recommend that you replace the refrigerator door gasket at the same time.<br />The only disappointment I had was the price! It seems like a lot of money for a piece of rubber gasket, but they gotcha - supply and demand! Lol!<br />Good luck!",1/14/14

It comes with a pad, which accounts for 1/3 the cost.  The frame was the least necessary part, but the distribution tray and yellow tube orifice were due for a replacement.  I scraped the mineral deposits off of the old tray and that ruined its function (The manual states to leave that deposit alone),  The yellow orifice had deteriorated also.  The solenoid valve that feeds this assembly was clogged, so I had to order a new one as well.  If you are troubleshooting your solenoid operation, take the outlet tube off (the one with the yellow orifice inserted in the end) and turn the system on...water should flow out of the solenoid like a water fountain.  This kit basically rebuilds everything after the solenoid.",1/12/14

General Electric GENERAL ELECTRIC WD28X10177 SILVERWARE BASKET,4,Y,It is what it is,I bought this to replace a less than satisfactory basket in our existing dishwasher which is not a GE.

We had a gas cooktop and decided to go with the induction to give a cleaner appearance on the island opposed ot the bulky gas cooktop.  We have had the item for a lttle over a month and we are loving it!!  Getting use to the way it cooks hasn't been as difficult as I thought it would be but finding the same type of pans we used on the gas cooktop has been challanging (style and size).

"GE PHP900DMBB Profile 30"" Black Electric Induction Cooktop",1,Y,Is there an inherent design problem with these units?,"I have purchased many GE appliances over the years and been very satisfied.  You expect \\""6 sigma\\"" products and service from GE.<br /><br />This arrived in good shape and worked as expected out of the box.  Cleaning is a breeze.  I do prefer Gas to induction as it seems to heat the whole pot instead of just the bottom.  So you need to learn to cook a little differently.<br /><br />Now the problem...less than 1 month of use and the \\""3 light\\"" problem showed up.  Only one burner was working.  Since the problem showed up, I have seen other reviews on Amazon and on other sites with the same issue.<br /><br />You can't call for service except during M-F business hours. The tech came out and said we needed parts but they were on backorder.  GE would not replace the unit despite not being able to tell when the parts would arrive.  They did offer to pay for a rental stove.  A rental stove?  You must be kidding.  Where would someone put such a thing?  On the back porch?  What about wiring?  LOL<br /><br />Long story short, it was a $600 control board which was installed about a month later.  Unit is now working normally.<br /><br />I would not recommend purchasing this unit as it may have a design issue or simply poor QC on their electronic boards.  You can't make a judgement based on one incident but why take a chance?<br /><br />BTW GE offered me nothing for the inconvenience and suggested buying an extended warranty for over $300.",1/9/14
GE Part Number WD28X10053 RACK LOWER & ROLLER ASSY,2,Y,"Does not match photo, worked OK after modification.","The photo is not what you'll get.  You'll end up with a completely different design.  I was not happy with the new design because instead of wire posts (as seen in the photo), the actual product has wire loops.  Imagine if you welded the tip of one of the wire posts to another wire post.  Then do that for every remaining pair of posts. This dramatically cuts down on the various ways the dishes can be placed in the rack.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that the wheels provided with the rack were not wide enough.  So when I slid the rack into the dishwasher, the entire rack fell into the bottom of the washer.  I managed to fix this by removing my old wheels (from the old rusted rack) and assembling them to the new rack.  Then I had to bend the metal supports outward to further increase the wheel width.  Whoever thought this is a direct replacement rack for the stock GE rack was completely wrong.",1/7/14

It is a very attractive, denovo, innovative, energy efficient, etc. refrigerator freezer.  It has a massive commanding appearance to it and fills the designated space perfectly. The look this model really brings out the appearance of my kitchen.  However, having only used side by side refrigerators for the past 43 years this one is going to take some getting used to.  The entire top being just refrigerator (very roomy) and the entire bottom being not only freezer but a pull out freezer with no bottom to the drawer itself (only one large wire basket) is really a different mind set.  I like the ice maker which is nice and compact and the smaller adjacent freezer drawer is nice as well.  After all is said and done though I think that more freezer space could be realized if the bottom was just two doors as is the top and shelves underneath the refrigerator!",1/6/14

While attempting to check plug connection, the wire connected to jack end separated.  Oh no!  Not just before Thanksgiving!  Ran to my computer for replacement. This probe had good reviews and looked like a direct replacement.  Arrived in time for Thanksgiving and works just fine. Came wrapped in a genuine GE part bag.

"GE GDF540HSDSS 24"" Stainless Steel Full Console Dishwasher - Energy Star",4,Y,"once you get used to it, it is better than average","we used to have the best dishwasher ever, quiet, cleaned anything and everything, no rinsing etc and after 15 years my 7 year old finally managed to jamb something in the pump where I couldn't get at it.<br /><br />I looked at a lot of dishwashers because the basic requirements for me are internal food disposal, pots and pans cycle and water heat. I was amazed at how many more expensive units didn't have all of those features. All in all this dishwasher works really well except the dish layout is a little frustrating. It is made to hold a 12 piece dinner place setting. If you aren't loading a 12 piece dinner place set the tines are too close together if you don't over load it it cleans pretty well with an occasional item that doesn't get everything.<br /><br />The silverware bins are truly annoying but if once you figure out that loading silverware in like groups, all spoons together for example, the it is easier to load and unload otherwise the utensils get stuck on the flap and well...  also don't put any forks or knives too close to the soap dispenser of they might block it from opening.<br /><br />One really nice feature with kids is that you can lock the control panel so they can't start and stop it just by hitting button ( we have had that happen plenty of times )<br /><br />the water temp is not as hot as my old unit, hence why it does not get as clean. Also the heated dry tends to create condensation when it is done so if you don't take them out and get third degree burns then they are wet when you do particularly plastic items.<br /><br />this dishwasher is also very quiet. In fact on occasion if there is some noise in the room, sometimes I am not sure it started.<br /><br />one more advantage I almost forgot is the rack height that is one other place It does have my old unit beat you can put really large stuff in the bottom without interfering with the spray arm.<br /><br />So all in all compared to a dishwasher I would have given a 5 and bought again if they still made it I give this one a 4. If they made the racks less complicated and the water temperature hotter then I would have said goodbye to the old one happily.",12/27/13

GE CYE23TSDSS Cafe 23.1 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Counter Depth French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,1,Y,Noisy and poorly made.,"UPDATE: I'm updating this review since this piece of junk is even worse than I'd thought.  First, the hot water dispenser was broken the day it was delivered. It just never worked properly. After 6 service calls, GE finally decided to replace the damn thing after they basically replaced all the electronics in the fridge, to no avail.  The new fridge is just as loud as the first one, but sometimes, it's much louder. It's like having a Harley running in your kitchen. It measured it with a decibel meter and the sound level came in at about 75 dB.  Worse, the fridge doesn't keep the temperature. I have all the temperatures set at the &#34;recommended&#34; settings, but the actual temperatures are WAY OFF. In short, EVERYTHING is FROZEN in the fridge. The water line doesn't work because the WATER IS FROZEN. All our vegetables have freezer burn and we had to throw them all away.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: A lot of people complained about the noise... I didn't think much of it when reading the reviews, but now I regret that I should have. Others have said this already: that it's normal, that it sounds different because of the variable-speed compressor. However, there's no excuse for it to be so loud.  Also worth mentioning is that the hot water dispenser is flaky at best. I've tried to make hot water 3 times, and 2 out of the 3 times, the fridge comes back with the dreaded &#34;Hot Water Disabled&#34; error message. Google this; others have had this problem. So I have to go to the panel and cycle the circuit breaker to get hot water to work.  The stainless steel is also quite cheap for a Cafe--it's something I'd expect on the mainline GE. It's the thin, shiny, with lots of coarse grain, nothing like more polished SS found in higher-end appliances.  And, just after one day, the cover on the touch panel for the temperature-drawer bin has already started peeling off.",12/27/13

GE PVM9215SFSS Profile 2.1 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Over-the-Range Microwave,4,Y,Great Microwave - highly rated on consumer reports - challenging installation,"Once installed, this is a good microwave.  The warranty is a good five year warranty and the microwave is rated highly on CR.  The door and handle seem just a little flimsy, and there is no popcorn button, but other than that a good machine.  The install is challenging.  Locating the exact location of where to drill the screw holes in the upper cabinet is difficult - using the templates provided is not a great method to find these holes.  Using a laser and measuring three times worked, but I was still just a little bit off as the brackets in the back - on the wall, dictate how the microwave will line up underneath.  The brackets on the wall allow for zero movement side to side - zero, so you need to be right on w/ the rear brackets or at least find your holes using where the brackets are on the wall and not where your cabinets are (side to side), if that makes sense.  If you have an old GE microwave, the bracket will likely be the same (as mine were), but the upper cabinet holes' location were different.",12/20/13

It may be smaller than some on the market, but it's also a shorter washer dimensionally, so that may have something to do with it. We have short countertops, and needed one a bit smaller.

No more digging.  Freezer space is luxurious compared to my old fridge. This new counter-depth has a smaller footprint and makes my small kitchen look bigger. It's not noisy. We love the beautiful lighting inside. I just like standing and looking in. And, I really like knowing it was made in Kentucky, not China.<br />Here's why I'm only giving it 3 stars:  The vegetable drawer is way too small. The design of the ice dispenser causes  crushed ice to bounce and spatter all over the floor. I don't see that I'd use the hot water feature.  I have to wait four minutes for a single 8 oz cup of water to heat up.  I'll stick with my whistling teapot on the stove. It fingerprints like crazy.

Capacity, 1000 Watt Over The Range Microwave Oven",3,Y,3 layers of menus,"I am frustrated I can't just hit a button and walk away and come back to cooked food.  To make it cheaper, they eliminated a number of buttons I used to use on my GE 1870 (magnatorn died).  I just want to cook some frozen vegetables!  I have tried a number of settings like Reheat vegetable, steam, or others and none of them just cook frozen vegetables like my old one.  Oh and to get to some of those, you have to go 3 or 4 menus deep.  The steam function always warns you to use the recommended steamer, I count that as a menu.  Look at the use manual before your purchase.  Oh an you have to babysit the steam function because it stops half way through.  I should also note that the nuts on top for attaching to the upper cabinet are only held on by cheep clips.  Don't  try to force anything, or the nut will rip through the thin metal and start spinning around and you will have to cut the bolt.  The nuts on my old microwave were attached much better.<br />I was also surprised that the sides of the door were only 1/2 stainless and the sides were totally grey.  They really cheeped out. FYI the inside is the bluish black pebble finish you usually see in an oven.<br />So what do I like....it used the same wall bracket as my JVM1870 when though they say it doesn't.  The metal on the bracket is thicker on the old wall hanger, so I kept using it instead.  The holes on top are in different places though.  Second thing I like, the down light button is physically separated on the bottom of the control panel.  It is easy to hit in the dark now, I like that.  Lastly, I like that this operates quieter than my old one.<br />I might just fix my old one because this is so hard to use.<br /><br />PS the bottom of the microwave is no longer flush and the vents and lights protrude.  This means that the plate inside is about 1/2 inch higher than before, something to consider for those of us that arn't so tall",12/15/13

You need to wait for HCCost to contact you with a window. While the delivery wasn't as fast as I would hope, it was getting frustrating with this fridge out of stock in Las Vegas, not to mention this Amazon deal was literally $300 cheaper than the nearest competitor.<br /><br />When it finally arrived, they unboxed it and slid it to the opening in my cabinets. I took it from there ($100 install fee for one stinkin' $8 tube? No thanks). Installation was self-explanatory.<br /><br />The fridge I received was free from defects on the outside.

"Genuine Aprilaire Humidifier Maintenance Kit 4839 - For Models 600, 600A, and 600M",5,Y,Return your humidifier to new shape or use to convert Aprilaire 400 to 600.,"I actually used this to convert a 400 series to a 600 series. I had originally put in the 400 because I liked that it conserved water, although because I have a heat pump I knew the efficiency would be greatly reduced. But I figured I'd give it a try. In the end, it was just a little too inefficient for me to tolerate. It can't quite keep up on extra dry winter days when the heat pump runs all day, so the humidity keeps gradually dropping and won't stay above 30% no matter how high I set the humidistat. We'll see how it works in 600 mode.<br />Anyways, I got this from the seller &#34;Filters-Now&#34;, and all the parts I needed were included. For annual maintenance, it really seems like overkill to replace all these parts, frankly, but it does pretty much return your humidifier to brand new condition.<br /><br />For anyone else who wants to try to convert an Aprilaire 400 humidifier to an Aprilaire 600 humidifier, know that this kit will do the trick. All you need to do is pull out the old water panel holder, then unscrew and remove the magnetic base component of the water level sensor assembly along with the white wires. Then rewire in the 24V power to the two yellow wires that runs the solenoid valve and you're set!",12/4/13

"GE JP256BMBB CleanDesign 22"" Black Electric Smoothtop Cooktop",1,Y,"Arrived Broken, replacement parts for this specialty cooktop are EXPENSIVE","The stove top arrived with two (both) broken burners.  I was doing an apartment kitchen remodel that ultimately took me 5-months to start and complete.  I had to wait for my tenant to move out, then I began the remodel.  When it arrived, I opened and inspected it, looked fine...packaged it back up for 5-months until the new kitchen and counters were in and ready for the cooktop install.  Once installed, the small burner did nothing, and the big burner heated and turned red, but was visibly crooked, and clearly not right.<br /><br />I removed it, open the back cover and saw that both heating elements were ruined during transit.  The clay insulator ring of the small burner was destroyed, had to buy a brand new replacement burner for $155!  The large burner was damaged, but I could piece it back together and get it aligned properly so it would work.  That replacement part was over $200...<br /><br />Unfortunately, I had waited so long to do the install, It was kind of past the timeframe that I could ask for an adjustment, so I just bit the bullet on this one.",12/3/13

"GE Profile PDT750SSFSS 24"" Built-In Dishwasher",5,Y,"One Outstanding Dishwasher, Really","We purchased the GE PDT750SSFSS Profile 24&#34; Stainless Steel Dishwasher to replace a mid 1990’s vintage Fridgeair which was installed in the home we purchased several months ago. The existing Frigidaire consistently failed to clean fully while consistently providing a noise level which made conversation difficult in the kitchen and rest impossible several rooms away. We have had several brands of dishwashers in homes over the last couple decades but settled on the new GE Profile 750 due to its low noise level and over 100 cleaning jets. We have not been disappointed. The unit shipped and arrived within two days of order and was in perfect condition. Instillation was delayed on our end as we found defective wiring to the existing dishwasher and had to have an electrician resolve that before we could install. After having it up and working we are totally impressed with this dishwasher.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />- This unit is super quiet; on its first run I had to put my ear against the door to make sure it was in fact running. GE advertises it at 42db which we viewed with some skepticism, but you can stand next to it and barely hear it at all.<br />- Cleaning is above average, even in corner positions and with Thanksgiving level loading. While at first the multiple wash cycles and options may seem like over kill, it does allow you to customize the run to the specific load.<br />- Features like the top rack bottle washers work great.<br /><br />Need for Improvement:<br /><br />- The installation instructions leave a little to be desired and the comic like illustrations do not provide significant detail when attempting to compare to the actual unit during instillation.<br />- One specific problem which occurred during instillation was when the drip-pan instillation was attempted as per the instructions; the positioning of the motor prevented it (not enough room between the floor). The unit had to be partially removed allowing it to be raised slightly, allowing the drip pan to be installed, then the unit pushed back into place. This is a sloppy miss by GE in the instillation staging.<br /><br />Overall we are thrilled with this dishwasher. To be sure it is not the cheapest on the market but we have no regrets given its performance. Will update the review should performance over time warrant.",11/29/13

About 6 months ago the bottom oven heating element stopped working.  It will cost about $300 plus to repair.  The top oven takes forever to heat and it burns everything.

GE CVM1790SSSS Cafe 1.7 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Over-the-Range Microwave - Convection,2,Y,2 defects in less than a month.  Too hot to touch when cooking on stovetop,"Display didn't light up so unit wasn't usable when it first arrived. GE service was pleasant and resolved after 2nd visit.  A few days later, the light under the microwave stopped working.  2 issues in less than a month doesn't bode well..  Also you can only heat in 15 sec increments when using the time dial.  But the good news...options for preconfigured settings for various items and their cooking times (potato, veg, etc...)  are fairly substantial and works efficiently.  HOWEVER.... I wouldn't recommend installing the microwave above your stove. Since the microwave is faced in stainless steel, the door handle and face of microwave gets extremely hot to the touch while cooking on the stovetop.  Speaking of the stove, I had much better luck with GEs Café Dual Range Gas stove.  Bought at the same time. No issues. Works great. Highly recommend stove without any hesitation. Absolutely love it!!!!! Wish I felt the same about the microwave.",11/24/13

"GE PHP900DMBB Profile 30"" Black Electric Induction Cooktop",4,Y,Still learning how to use,Installation of the cook top was painless.  You do have to upgrade the electrical breaker to 40 amps. It works well once cook ware is properly located on the element but it is difficult to see the element  when placing a pan of (close to) equal diameter.  Had to fight with error codes on that one for a while.  The reduced cook time is amazing and the number of heat selections appropriate and required. The element boost feature is great.  Have to use the Control Lock feature between uses otherwise just cleaning will turn on the elements.  Amazons delivery was exactly as stated and we followed detailed delivery status from shipper to receiver.  So far we are very pleased with product.,11/22/13

GE REFRIGERATOR WATER LINE TUBE CONNECTOR 5/16X5/16 WR02X11330,5,Y,Works Great for its Intended Purpose,"These are alot easier to use than the standard union with nut and ferrule.  Just push the tubing in until it bottoms.  And they don't leak as long as you cut your tubing square and clean.  They are meant for the 5/16&#34; plastic chilled water tubing used on friges with chilled water dispensers.  Since that tubing circuit occurs AFTER the solenoid valve, it's a very low pressure circuit.  So don't try to use one of these on your 60+ PSI water supply or you might be disappointed.",11/16/13

"GE Cafe CGP650SETSS 36"" Built-In Gas Cooktop",5,Y,LOVE this cooktop! Can't wait to use it every day!!,"Love, love, love this cooktop. I am still blown away by how I got it shipped for free by being a Amazon Prime customer! It is so heavy due to all the cast iron, it would have been unaffordable to get it anywhere else! And it was around $300 less than the 'big home stores'. It even came with the cast iron griddle! Yes it's heavy- but it's supposed to be! I am not sure why some other reviewers actually griped about the weight of the grates and griddle. They are supposed to be heavy! If they were lighter, I don't think the quality would have been there.<br />I especially love the center power burner! It took only 11 minutes to bring a full pot of cold water to a boil! My last one took over 30 minutes. Since I am in Hawaii and all we have here is propane, this will make a HUGE difference on my propane usage! It even came with the LP converter kit so I did not have to go buy one!<br />I could not be happier with this cooktop. And it looks so good!

"GE Cafe CGP650SETSS 36"" Built-In Gas Cooktop",5,Y,Excellent Features for a Gas Cooktop... Good Value,"Firstly, this is not the most inexpensive cooktop out there. In fact, we saw some prices from $800 to $1200, which caught my eye. But I had to remind myself of the most important point... \\""We use our cooktop every single day!\\"" Much like our cars, but even more, we will be using this item for more years than we'll probably keep our cars. And because I'm the one who... \\""Lives to Eat!, rather than Eat to Live\\"", I'll spend an extra $400 or $500 to get what I deem is \\""the best value\\"" for our needs. I should note that one huge driving force for buying through Amazon was saving approximately $150 on the item, plus not having to pay another $120 in sales tax. And of course, with Prime... we got this item in \\""Two-Days!\\"" (Yaa-Team!)<br /><br />Like many others, I looked online, and in the stores. One common thread regarding the GE Cafe line of gas cooktops...? ... Home Depot, Sears and other stores all carried this model in stock. I had no problem seeing, touching and comparing it to others \\""on the floor.\\"" Forgetting price, it won out, even over the Kenmore Elite Series, which actually was about $400 less, but not as \\""commercial looking.\\""<br /><br />Up front, I'll share my greatest fear about buying this type of item online....... \\""damage in shipping, requiring a return process which wastes time.\\"" The cooktop is delivered in the orginal GE corrugated box, with the stainless cooktop surrounded and distanced from all corners of the box. There are three straps holding the corrugated together. One of our straps was missing, but the box survived, and while a few small boxed parts may shift inside, fear not......... the cooktop is \\""stationary\\"" in its' foam nest. Bottom line, other than a FedEx or UPS drive dropping the box harshly to where something pierces it and the range... I have a feeling most of these units arrive in their \\""OEM, New condition.\\""<br /><br />So, I've been cooking, literally, since I was a very young lad. And I have an electro-mechanical background, which helps as much as haunts my every decision when comparing prior to buying. I was as excited to upgrade our cooktop as my wife. And here's a few features that made this an easy choice for us, after looking at many other brands, features and appearance:<br /><br />BURNER LOCATION IN RELATIONSHIP TO GRIDS:<br />Burners are distanced a bit more than you'll see in other gas cooktops. That allows for more a more efficient transfers of heat to your pans, and insures more even heating.<br /><br />BURNER SIZES and KNOB/VALVE CONTROL:<br />There is a \\""Fifth Burner, Center\\"", that has the highest BTU rating, and will heat a large \\""Restaurant Pot\\"" of liquid quickly.<br />The \\""Rear Right\\"" burner is purposely small, and will allow cooking and melting delicates... butters, chocolates, etc.<br />All burners have an incredibly \\""low simmer setting.\\"" This means GE is using high quality valves-burner controls.<br />Overall, you have control over your burners that you may have \\""fought for\\"" with your old cooktop.<br /><br />OVERALL BUILD QUALITY:<br />From the heavy cast iron grids to the heavy built control knobs, this Cafe Series is closer to commercial equipment; it's not a lightweight.<br /><br />INCLUDES BLUE LED HALO-LIGHTING WHEN A KNOB/VALVE IS \\""ON\\"":<br />An incredibly smart feature! I'm embarrassed to share how many times I've left a burner on when making our morning pour-over Brasilian demitasse coffee. It requires an incredibly low temp simmer to keep the coffee hot, without burning the coffee... (a huge no-no). Manys the time I've forgotten to turn that burner off when I transfer the coffee to a serving urn. The blue LED halo-lighting can easily be seen, especially at night, and is an instant reminder that you're \\""gas is on!\\""<br /><br />SAFETY LOCK-OUT:<br />There's actually a safety lock-out knob that allows you to disable all of the gas knobs. We only have one grandchild under one-year right now, so I'm not sure we'll have to worry about this right now. But I'm sure I'll find another reason for assigning this feature \\""5-stars!\\""<br /><br />INCLUDES A CAST IRON GRIDDLE INSERT:<br />We've been cooking with Lodge-brand cast iron skillets for quite awhile. So when I saw that the griddle adapter was made by Lodge, I was impressed. And what was interesting was the specialized burner control for use of the griddle. The \\""Rear Left\\"" control includes a setting that will control both of the left side burners \\""In-Tandem.\\"" It's specific to the use of the griddle, and gives you the even heating you'll need for golden flapjacks! Another item... like the distancing of the burners to the cooking grids, (extra distance for even heat), the griddle stands up a bit from the burners too, which adds to \\""even heating.\\""<br /><br />While no gas cooktop is perfect, I felt like we not only got a very fair deal buying via Amazon online, but we actually got the best product for our needs. It took me two hours to remove the old (18 years) GE Profile 36\\"" gastop with downdraft venting system.... AND ONLY 30 MINUTES to install this new Cafe Series. Of course, once you have a pre-cut hole in your counter, it's really just a matter of insuring a good fit, and customizing your sealing of the cooktop to the counter material.

The \\""Rear Left\\"" control includes a setting that will control both of the left side burners \\""In-Tandem.\\"" It's specific to the use of the griddle, and gives you the even heating you'll need for golden flapjacks!

"GE JV536HSS Profile 30"" Stainless Steel Under Cabinet Range Hood - 250 CFM",5,Y,Very good product at a good value,"I've bought two of these. The first was a replacement for another hood that was too noisy, underwhelming in appearance, didn't evacuate enough air, and had a wimpy light. I was happy enough with the performance, the quiet, the appearance, and the price that I bought the exact same thing a second time when I remodeled the kitchen in my next house. The noise level is tolerable, the amount of air moved is adequate for almost any kitchen, and the lighting is quite good.  I should also point out that it evacuates neither too little nor too much air.  A fan that's too powerful will suck makeup air into the house from undesirable places -- the exhaust stack on the gas water heater, the fireplace, the sewage vent pipes, and so on. Some local codes require complicated equalization if a stove hood exceeds some particular CFM level. This one has a low enough level to avoid that issue, but is strong enough to evacuate the evidence of almost any kitchen misadventure.  Too many stove hood installations have ducting that shoots straight up and goes through the cabinets above. That robs space, adds a bit of noise unnecessarily, and looks tacky when you open the cabinet. Shooting the duct out the back of the hood into the wall, then up between the studs is a much cleaner way. This model makes that method of installation easy. Most don't.  I don't want to move again, but if I have another house that comes with a second-rate stove hood, I may very well buy this one a third time.",11/1/13

GE Clothes Dryer Motor Blower Motor WE17X10008,5,Y,Installation tips,This is the blower motor for the GE Profile Harmony Dryer series DPGT750EC.  It took me about two hours to replace the blower (amateur).  It’s very helpful to follow the detailed instruction in Publication #31-9104 GE Technical Service Guide.  One note of caution:  if you are trouble shooting the dryer the publication incorrectly lists the ohms for the inlet thermistor as 2.27k ohms on page 30.  Page 40 lists the correct value of 227k ohms.  The manual lists these two items as the most common cause of the blower not operating.  I had an intermittent problem.  Replacing the motor fixed the problem.,10/17/13

"GE PHP900DMBB Profile 30"" Black Electric Induction Cooktop",4,Y,It's good,Nice cooktop. I don't have many complaints except that you need to buy specific size pots in order for certain circles to work and it can be difficult to clean especially when cooking oily foods.,10/14/13
"GE PHS925STSS Profile 30"" Stainless Steel Electric Slide-In Induction Range - Convection",5,Y,A generational change in cooking technology,"This range is an amazing piece of technology. The level of control you have with the induction cooktop just blows away that of any other range you have ever used. Because you are not transferring heat from a burner to a pan, but are exciting the molecules of the pan directly through a magnetic field, you have instant and precise control over your cooking, and an unparalleled evenness of heat in your cookware. Gone are the days of moving pieces of food back and forth between the center and edges of the pan while sauteing. Every piece of food anywhere in the pan cooks just like every other. Everything about the induction cooktop is faster than you're used to. About the only time you'll set this on high is when you want to boil water, and you'll be amazed how quickly that happens... just over two minutes for a 3-qt sauce pan half full. It takes a bit of adjustment to get used to the different timing of things. I like how it boils more quickly, but it's changed all my timing of when to start water for potatoes or pasta. Where you may be used to putting a saute pan on medium high and giving it several minutes to be hot enough for water to 'dance', it will be about 30 seconds with this one, and it's easy to smoke your oil until you get used to using lower settings than you're used to. Once you get used to it, though, you'll love the level of control you have over your food. In fact, you have such fine control that you don't need a double-boiler for tasks like melting chocolate. This cooktop has such precise control that you can melt delicate foods in a single pan. Yes, you may have to retire a few old favorite pots and pans, but there are many high-quality multi-ply stainless steel products out there that will work brilliantly, as will traditional and enameled cast iron. I have had this range for three weeks and I already cannot imagine going back to a primitive electric or gas cooktop.<br /><br />The oven in the range does a very nice job, though we're still getting usedto how it varies from our old one. One thing to be aware of is that they turn a 'feature' on by default that lowers your temperature by 25 degrees when using convection without telling you that its doing it and without showing you the actual temperature in the oven. Personally, I think that's daft. Your oven should heat to the temperature that you set, and even if they think some people will like this, it should be off by default. They give you a way to turn this off so that your oven is accurate while convection cooking, but if your electricity is interrupted it loses that change and you'll have to remember to reset it. (A bit of non-volatile memory would have been nice for retaining your settings in a power outage.) Other than that little quibble, though, the oven couldn't be nicer. I love that it shows you the temperature while pre-heating, and the easy slide rack is fantastic for a heavy item that needs to be pulled out to check its temperature. It maintains a relatively even temperature and is extremely well-insulated. We haven't used the warming drawer yet, but I think it will come in handy at times.<br /><br />That's pretty much what I have to say about operating the range, but there were some notable things about buying and installing this range that are worth commenting on for those who may buy online and/or install it themselves as we did. The range is very heavy, between 200 and 250 pounds, so you will want to take this into consideration when planning the installation (assuming you will do it yourself). You'll definitely need a hand truck to move it into the kitchen and you'll want to protect your floor from the feet when moving it into place. We set it on a piece of heavy material to slide it around to protect the hardwood floor and that worked well. Putting the plug on is easy, so don't let that dissuade you from installing it yourself. It comes with an anti-tip bracket that should be screwed into the wall or floor for one of the rear feet to slide into. This prevents the range from tipping forward accidentally, which would be pretty serious with something this heavy. At first, it looks like getting it all lined up will be a pain, but they have made it so that you just install the edge of the bracket exactly where the edge of the range goes and everything lines up. It turned out to be very simple, and is cheap protection for the type of accident it is trying to prevent. Leveling the range was a but fiddly, as it is with any range, but it wasn't hard if you remove the warming drawer first. Be sure to take the time to use a spirit level.<br /><br />Most slide-in ranges won't directly replace a free-standing range, because they are less deep and require a piece of counter behind them. This range is the same depth as a free-standing range, which could be good or bad for you. If you already have a free-standing range, it's great because it is a direct replacement and it will fit. If you already have a slide-in range, check the installation guide before installing to be sure this will fit. It may not. I really enjoy having the controls on the front so I don't have to reach over hot pots and pans to adjust a control.<br /><br />The oven vents heat, and some moisture, from a vent at the back, so be sure you have an appropriate backsplash behind the range. We put a stone backsplash behind our counters and thought about putting it behind the range. Instead, we ended up with a stainless steel backsplash directly behind the range and stone behind everything else. I'm glad we did that because we can see the moist condensation on the backsplash sometimes. Stone would not have been a good material for that.<br /><br />Buying this range online was a bit of an adventure in itself. I saved several hundred dollars by doing that, but it wasn't without a certain amount of trouble and risk. There was a mix up between the seller (Amazon 3rd party seller) and the carrier, with the seller telling me it had shipped and the carrier telling me it hadn't. This lasted about a week and created some stress. Receiving an item from a freight carrier is quite different than receiving something shipped by UPS. The carrier called me to arrange a time, but there was confusion about exactly what service they were to provide. They started by telling me that they would bring it in the truck and that I would have to unload it. For extra money, they would lower it to the ground and for more extra, they would move the box inside. Be sure you get this worked out with your seller before you finalize your order. It's the seller that sets the terms of the delivery. Then, on the day of the delivery, the driver called to verify that he could get a tractor-trailer into and out of my street. (The answer was a definite 'no'.) Unfortunately, they assumed I knew it would arrive in a tractor-trailer and I assumed a company delivering an appliance to a home would use something the size of a furniture delivery truck. This had the potential to be a real problem, but luckily the driver was really great. I drove my garden trailer out to the truck and he came back with me and helped me get it in the garage. He didn't have to do that last part, though, so it could have been a very difficult time. The upshot is, if you buy this range online, be sure you consider all these issues and get them worked out before the delivery day. There were several times in this process during which I was wishing I'd paid the extra money and bought it locally, but it all worked out really well in the end, so now I'm pleased to have saved the money.<br /><br />All in all, I couldn't be happier with this new range. I know that professional chefs love gas (and I did, too, before) but I don't care who you are. Once you've used an induction cooktop, you'll never go back to gas or electric again. It has all the instant control advantages of gas with the precision and consistency of digital controls and the ubiquity of electric. Combine that with a large, high-end convection oven, and you have an exceptional cooking appliance. I enthusiastically recommend this range.",10/14/13

Box had some wear but nothing alarming. Our contractor opened this up and it was COMPLETELY destroyed so we had to pack it up and have it picked up to ship back. In the meantime I ordered another thinking surely it was just damaged in shipping with the first. WRONG! The second one came next day, box looked good and once opened the back of it was so heavily damaged we are now convinced it could not have done it in shipping. We believe people order them, they are fine, go to install and have issues and they are dropped or damaged at that time. These things are heavy and there is no way the damage done could have been from the UPS guy dropping the box, they were clearly out of the box.

When we remodeled our kitchen we wanted to get a gas line added for a gas stove, but this looked like it was going to be an expensive and difficult solution due to our house layout.  We looked at induction stoves and we thought that it would cook similar to gas so we decided that we would go with induction.  We love this stove top.  It heats up very quickly and of course when you turn it off the heat is gone.  We also found that this stove top is a very easy to clean, far easier then the past electric and gas stoves that we have owned in the past.  Highly recommended!",9/29/13

"GE JGB870SETSS 30"" Stainless Steel Gas Sealed Burner Double Oven Range - Convection",4,Y,"arrived on time, communication could be improved",I ordered a range which I received on the last day of the 4 day window that I was given.  The delivery people were nice and set the appliance in the house as promised.  E-mails from HCCost were returned promptly.  My only issues were that I called the trucking company to provide a phone number to schedule the delivery and they used the one I let them know that no one had access to.  I did not know the delivery was coming due to this and Amazon did not correctly track it telling me it was still en route out of state.  What was most upsetting is that Amazon does not have a phone number form this vendor so cannot quickly assess the situation nor provide support.  In my opinion they should not use a 3rd party that will not provide a phone number to address issues.,9/26/13
GE CYE23TSDSS Cafe 23.1 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Counter Depth French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,5,Y,CAFE Series Counter-Depth Fridge,This is a awesome fridge that is now made in the US and on the leading edge with its hot water options. I strongly encourage you to measure the needed space because the counter depth fits much better in older homes that do not have large cutouts for the fridge. The interactive display is great as a control center and you can upload pictures for a on-demand slideshow. The LED lighting and large bins provide plenty of storage and is a nice change from the traditional side by side setup. I priced this out at several home improvement stores and even with the shipping from purchasing at Amazon I saved ~$350. This is a great product.,9/25/13

GE CFE29TSDSS Cafe 28.6 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,5,Y,"Works great, lots of room","Update: Almost another year, and it's still working great. Maybe I got lucky, but I have had no problems with it.  1) While the refrigerator is noisier than my old one, the manual does state that it will be a little louder. The only time I hear it is in the morning or late evening when it's quiet in the house, otherwise, I don't even notice it.  2) I still very rarely use the hot water.  3) I still think it's great with lots of room and have had no cooling issues.  4) I still think filters are way over priced :-)  ------------ Update: After about 1 year later, I'm still loving the fridge. It's been working great and I've had no problems since the initial repair for the USB. (Maybe it's time I updated the pictures on it again). The filter cost is way outrageous (but so is every other filter for refrigerators, it's kind of like ink for printers).  ---------------- I love the fridge. It's roomy, bright and easy to get to everything. I've had it for two months so far.  Pros: Easy access to most everything. Well lit Nice gadgety front touch screen GE service was easy to contact and easy to get a repairman out there. (see below about the repair) The water/ice taste great (my old refrigerator never had good tasting water or ice) All around, it's a great product and keeps a stable temperature.  Cons: Can't see the temperature in freezer and fridge unless you act like you're going to change the temperature on the display panel, then it will show the current temperature. I guess they figured it will be at what you set it.  I had a repairman out within two days of getting the fridge because the USB port did not work. (I'm a gadget freak and that's the first thing I tried). It took about a week for the both the parts and the repairman to come out, but I was in no hurry as it wasn't like the fridge was ruining food.  Hot water is kind of a waste. I use it every now and then, but having to wait 5 minutes for hot water is kind of long. Especially for the few ounces that you get each time. I have a full time hot water dispenser next to it, so I guess I'm spoiled.  Water dispenser stops if the door is opened (either side)... not sure why it would stop if the right side is opened, but it does.  It does run somewhat louder than my old fridge, but not enough to complain about. (Maybe a better term is that it has a different sound than my old fridge... not sure if it's louder)  Summary: I would buy it again. The price I got was incredible so I couldn't refuse ;-)...",9/24/13

GE Profile PVM1790 Stainless Steel Over-The-Range Microwave Oven,1,Y,UPS Strikes Again,"After UPS destroyed a Whirlpool unit last week, I opted to upgrade to this GE model.  The mistake I made was allowing UPS to handle the shipment again.  It is becoming apparent that UPS cannot handle anything that requires a hand truck without damaging it.  I would suggest that Amazon include a carrier option for shipping heavy items to possibly preclude damage in shipment.  For me, UPS would fall just below the kid down the street with his little red wagon.  As to the GE microwave, it arrived with two corners completely bashed in and assorted other small dents.  Not exactly a 30,000 foot drop, but enough to render it unusable.  If I'm ever able to once again enjoy receiving, installing and using an over-the-range microwave oven, I'll be sure to review its salient points.  Oh, and all potential buyers should be aware that if you purchase any item like this from a vender who does not have the caveat \\""fulfilled by Amazon\\"" next to their name,and you have to return the item, you will simply have to wait for the item to arrive back at the vender and then rely on the vender to reimburse the cost.

All you have to do if your fridge has an adapter is to take off the adapter and install it on the filter then instal into the refrigerator.  Also if you have to you can grip the adapter with a plumbers pliers and press down firmly . the filter will seat and then just install in the fridge.

It made the sound as if it would be fouling, but did not! I am sending it back- it will be picked up at my house.

Using it with LP but still seems to generate all the BTU's I need.  I use it for both cooking and canning.  Fan noise is not an issue at all, even when convection baking.  Wish I'd gotten this range long ago.  Beautiful to look at, especially when paired with my new stainless steel range hood.  The description on Amazon doesn't tell you but the sides are black.  That didn't matter in my installation but since this a freestanding range you should know that little detail.  The GE website does note that fact.  I'm happy and recommend this range.",8/23/13

General Electric GENERAL ELECTRIC WD28X10177 SILVERWARE BASKET,5,Y,Gets the job done,"It's a silverware basket, but I do have one gripe with it. The slotted holes that cover the basket aren't wide enough for some of our wide handled silverware, the kind that really flares towards the end. But thankfully the the covers can be removed pretty easily, so I just took the covers off the two side baskets and kept the cover in the middle one. It fit our Fridgidaire dishwasher really nicely too.",8/21/13

GE Dryer Front Drum Slide WE1M333,2,Y,Poor replacement for an even worse design,"These plastic drum slides wear out faster than the default iphone ringtone.  It's bad enough that the design uses a RUBBING slide bearing instead of an actual ball bearing design.  Really?  When you've got a small family of four, you go through enough laundry to load the dryer down to where it really needs more proper loading.  There's definitely a level of wear-it-out-only-after-warranty-expiration going on here.<br /><br />Again, these replacements are worse than the original design or at the least as bad.  At least it takes only a few minutes to replace them.  Keep a spare set handy or you'll need to replace the entire drum &#34;bearing&#34; assembly (the plastic front piece these guys attach to.)",8/16/13
GE Part Number WE1M507 SLIDE DRUM - GREEN,3,Y,"it is original equipment (OEM), so that's good","This part is basically a rectangular piece of plastic.

GE Part Number WD03X10006 SPRING DOOR BK 20 LB,3,Y,GE Triton dishwasher,I gave this item 3 stars because it was not what was in the picture or as described.  It was supposed to come with a small clip to hook on my dishwasher hinge door and then this spring would hook into the clip and the bottom of the frame.  Well this item didn't come with the clip so I had to adjust the hook and make it a bit tighter so it would hold onto my door hinge.  It works OK for now and it's not as springy as I would like it to be.  The other spring on my dishwasher didn't break just one side.  We'll see what happens.,8/13/13

GE Part# WB21X5301 Sensor Assembly (OEM),1,Y,Not as advertized,Temperature sensor did not have connector as shown in photo. Only bare wires. Not equivalent to original GE part.

Cooktop performs extremely well.<br /><br />Thats the good news...  The bad??  Replacement was a disaster! In their infinite wisdom, GE CHANGED the downdraft connection from a 6&#34; round pipe to a 3x12 rectangular connection.  It was almost impossible to reconnect to the existing vent piping.  If you are replacing an older GE product, you will need to get some FLEX piping!!!! Note - blowers will not interchange with older models, so you can't just 'steal' the old blower /housing and re-use...  Whoever the design change person is in GE, they need to have to test-change out their products and see what a pain they've created by the change!!!!!!!!!!",8/12/13
"GE PS978STSS Profile 30"" Stainless Steel Electric Slide-In Smoothtop Double Oven Range - Convection",5,Y,Great range,Delivery went without a hitch and this oven is a pleasure.

The model number of my dishwasher starts in PDC, but this fits perfectly.  I was worried, as the dimensions didn't seem exactly right, but it is a perfect fit.  The unit is sturdy.

Everything heats up really, really fast, though - burners and oven.  The controls are super easy and intuitive to use, too.  It's well insulated so I can bake using the top oven and my kitchen doesn't get hot during the summer.  I've read the reviews as to quality control issues so plan on buying an extended warranty for it before the factory warranty expires.<br /><br />The timer has a quiet little beep to it that is hard to hear, so that's one thing I think they ought to change.

"GE JGB870SETSS 30"" Stainless Steel Gas Sealed Burner Double Oven Range - Convection",1,Y,Not that dependable,Bottom oven does not cook frozen biscuits very good. You have to spin the pan around. Use this in commercial kitchen and should have bought a commercial convection oven. Plus the igniter glow bar went out after being used only three months. Order a new part from GE and they sent the wrong part. Was down a week. I got the right part a week latter and the part came in broke! The part was not protected in the box it was packaged in. Another week without a stove! Got another one in and guess what? It was broke too! After another long call with GE and three weeks with no oven I have another one coming! I am service tech and do not recommend this style of ignition.,8/2/13

However, a Sears sales associate advised me to look for a compatible part from another brand. That lead me to this GE water line tube connector. It fit perfectly, easy to install, and works great! If you need any help installing, search for the part number WR02X11330 on youtube and you'll find a short video showing how to install this part.

This company sent it out quickly and packaged real nice. Have you seen new microwaves today? Getting cheap and all the reviews on them are horrible. Tried a high end appliance store and they have the same junk the home stores have. This part is easy to replace and besides the transformer, it's the most likely part that needs replaced.

GE Part Number WD35X10351 BUILT IN DW CONVRSN KIT,2,Y,Picture should be provided so you know you don't need this,"First vendor sent the wrong part, but they were very helpful in getting the correct part to me.  Basically I spent $150 for a hose and four metal feet for the dishwasher.  Instructions were important, but they weren't very good.  We ended up having to go to Sears for another hose and connection that wasn't included.  I would have sent it back, but it would be more trouble to disconnect the hose that we did use than it was worth.  The kick plate that was provided would have made the kit worth the money, except we couldn't figure out how to attach it.  So, we connected the dishwasher without the kick plate, only using one hose and four little feet from the kit.  I think the reason a picture is not provided for this item is because once you see the pieces you figure out you can go somewhere else and get the parts for a lot less.",7/25/13
GE WB2X3138 Oven Door Gasket with Wire,5,Y,Keep the heat in the oven!,"Before we upgraded the gasket seal on our oven, it got so hot in the kitchen that at times we could just leave the food sitting on the adjacent counter top to cook it. One time we were even able to roast marshmallows from the blistering heat that radiated from around the range seal. Not any more! The new oven door gasket keeps the heat in the oven where it belongs.

The oven and range elements heat up quickly and I love that the oven light automatically turns on when you open the door, like a refrigerator.

At first glance it looks like an exact replacement for the defective part.  After installing it and trying to put the ice bucket back in place a few times, I realized that something was different.  I compared the old part to the new part and noticed that there was an additional tab extension on the new part that bumped one of the screws and prohibited the ice bucket from properly securing to the glide.  In all fairness, it also appeared that the old part also had this tab extension originally but someone cut it off.  So I cut it off of the new part and everything fit perfectly.  In the end it worked but it required a wire cutter and strong hands to cut the plastic in order for it to fit.",7/9/13

The various features give the user many options for handling different laundering needs. The spin cycles are a bit noisy, especially a low frequency humming sound felt throughout the house.

"GE CGP350SETSS Cafe 30"" Stainless Steel Gas Sealed Burner Cooktop",5,Y,Amazing cooktop!,"I replaced a horrible glass top 30&#34; cooktop with this one- and it's fabulous! It feels much bigger than its 30 inches. So far I've used two frying pans at the same time- with one in the middle and one on the bottom left burner.<br /><br />It starts up right away- I love the blue light that comes on under the knob. The only down side I've found is that if two burners next to each other are going, that blue light reflects on the closest knob and almost looks like it's lit as well. I still love the light, and it's well worth that tiny inconvenience.<br /><br />I absolutely love this cooktop!",7/3/13

"GE PGP989DNBB Profile 30"" Black Gas Sealed Burner Cooktop - Downdraft",3,Y,"Does the job, but comes with complications","For some reason GE decided to make the bottom of the backdraft rectangular instead of circular, which is how the vents are made.  this required an extensive amount of work to get the backdraft vent hook upped.<br /><br />The cook top itself works fine.  The fan, when on low, is pretty quiet and does the job well.",7/2/13

GE Part Number WD12X10327 Roller & Stud ASM - 4 Pack,5,Y,Did the job w/out any fuss.,"Most difficult part of this was finding out what parts to purchase, as GE uses this item, as well as some similar looking ones, on most of their dishwashers.  I would have appreciated if the installation instructions had been included, but if one removes 1 @ a time, and pays attention as to how the original parts were installed, it should be a piece of cake for most everyone.  My wife wanted a new dishwasher since the upper rack had fallen off the broken original rollers, and had dumped some nice glassware & cups onto the floor, but I surprised her w/ her newly refurbished dishwasher, and saved about $500.  All is good.  And, the supplier did a credible job - very reasonable cost (incl shipping), and filled the order correctly the first time - a wonder of wonders these days - and I rec'd the parts in a couple of days.",6/30/13

GE JX81B Recirculating Charcoal Filter,1,Y,"Wrong replacement filters, not as advertised","I do a great deal of research before I purchase a product, no matter what it is.  I scoured the manufacturer's product documentation, spend hours going to various web sites to ensure these were the right replacement parts, and ordered from Amazon.  Came as usual zippy-quick, and unfortunately, these were not the correctly sized filters as promised.  I was ticked off.  It was going to be more effort to send this back than just throw out, not work my time and trouble.  Considering everything we've purchased over the years, not a huge deal, but still annoying.",6/28/13
"GE CGP350SETSS Cafe 30"" Stainless Steel Gas Sealed Burner Cooktop",5,Y,Excellent performance from GE's Cafe Cooktop,"This beautifully designed cooktop functions as well as it looks.  The installation process took all of about 20 minutes, including installing a new flexible gas line between the cooktop and wall on/off gas line fitting.<br /><br />All of the components appear to be top quality, and the grates and grill have the rugged look and weight of a commercial cooktop.<br /><br />I'm getting good cooking results with the burners set on low/medium low, allowing plenty of heat to cook just about anything with non-stick cookware. The heating elements, as well as the controls, are definitely a huge step above the GE standard line of appliances.  It's easy to fine tune the amount of heat at each burner. A nice feature is the illumination of the control knob when a burner is being used.<br /><br />The center burner, which is capable of quickly boiling a pot of water, is very handy for quickly bringing up any liquid to boiling point, while at the same time, having infinitely low control for light simmering.  Even though the cooktop grates are set up higher than my old GE cooktop, I'm finding that I am getting the same cooking results without having to turn up the burners.<br /><br />All in all, a beautiful piece of kitchen equipment that functions as intended.  The design takes full advantage of the 30&#34; cooktop width to allow for a 5 burner placement.  A huge improvement from my older GE 4 burner set up.  No complaints at all on this product.",6/28/13

GE JP328SKSS 30 Electric Cooktop - Stainless Steel,5,Y,Good Cooktop,"It is getting increasingly difficult to find a electric cooktop that is not a smooth top unit. My ancient cooktop quit working, so I bought and installed this one which my wife likes much better than the old one. We haven't noticed any more heat around the coil areas than the old unit had; yes, within an inch or two of the coil it is very hot, but I think that is to be expected. We haven't noticed any undue flexing of the unit. The knobs give a much wider range than our old stove that had pushbuttons, so can control the heat much better. It cleans up easy enough.<br /><br />Installation was pretty straight forward, other than some retrofitting that I had to do as the old unit was some odd size a little larger than this--not the fault of this unit. I imagine that someone halfway handy with tools and knowledgeable enough on electrical wiring could replace an existing cooktop in one to two hours. I think I did our install in about four hours and that was with making the counter hole smaller so the unit wouldn't fall through and a trip to the hardware store to get some wire nuts.",5/11/13
GE Part Number WB1X1293 SCREW,1,Y,over priced,I paid $5.95 for one screw plus an additional six dollars for shipping.<br /><br />I found I needed more than one screw to install a gas range oven igniter.<br /><br />I just order five more screws from another company for $1.25 each.,5/11/13

GE CSA1201RSS Cafe Advantium 1.7 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Over-the-Range Microwave - Convection,5,Y,Unit is Top of the line,Just installed the microwave and it has a lot of options. Just getting used to it. Unit did arrive with 2 minor dents to the exterior cabinet. Didn't return item because damage was hidden by install and didn't effect the operation of the unit.

GE Part Number WC3X124 SPLASH GUARD,1,Y,"Shoddy item, poor customer support","This GE splash guard failed completely after less than three months of normal (what's normal?) use. Normal could be like us, a two person household that does NOT dispose of  20 pounds of bones from a side of beef, or 25 pounds of vegetable garbage, etc. each week. Simply typical use ~ PERIOD. Vendor claims that we would have had to contact them within 14 days or return the item(s) within 30 days! How on earth can one determine if an item is sub-standard in 14 days, when it is an item that has to be USED (in a normal manner) in order to determine it's quality. I do not recommend purchasing from this vendor, Laundry Doc. They apparently don't understand the \\""service\\"" part of Customer Service.",5/3/13

GE JVM1950SRSS Spacemaker 1.9 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Over-the-Range Microwave,3,Y,I would have liked it better had it not arrived with a DENT on the door.,"I like the microwave itself, hence the &#34;3 Stars&#34;. They get &#34;0&#34; stars for Customer Service. I purchased this microwave for a new home I was moving to. It came in record breaking time to the old house I was still in,  and I planned to move in about a month's time. The microwave was double packaged and one could not open it without cutting the outer box at the bottom, as instructed without ruining the outside box. I choose not to open it, since I planned to move it,  and that was my first big mistake. Should have opened it anyway. The packaging was substantial, and would have been impossible to repack.  I took it to my new home as I had planned and left it with my contractor to open and install. He called me and told me that there was a small dent on the door of the microwave.  When I went to ask for an exchange, Amazon said the time was up for any returns or exchanges, and I could not return the item. I was only a day or two over the limit of returns. I WILL NEVER BUY ANY LARGE APPLIANCE or anything of that kind again from Amazon. It was sold through another Amazon store, and I emailed them about it, and they wanted pictures, etc.  I was in the process of getting those pictures for them (I hadn't moved into the house, and I was only there on weekends), and in the meantime Amazon closed the process down of returning or exchanging.  Very mad about this...nothing to do, but suck it up and look at the dent each day to remind me never to buy anything like this again with such an inflexible return policy.",5/1/13

I could not believe it when I saw them at this store and the price was about half of what another store wanted who had some after market not Genuine GE.

They are a narrower gage than the original equipment and therefore not stay on the track. Fortunealy I had read prior reviews and was able to switch out the wheels. This was not an easy task as the clips on new wheels are difficult to work with and I ended up scaring the coating on the new rack.

Unfortunately -- and I don't know the technical terms for this -- it plugs into the computer to work and sucked the power from it so our son's computer games didn't work properly.

Almost all of he new GE cooktops are like this and after reading tons of reviews I am confident that they are all wrong. Do a little research as to what the hottest part of the flame actually is. I will save you some time and tell you that it is the very tip. This cooktop heats faster and heats more evenly that the GE profile that it replaced.<br />the power burner is awesome for boiling, If you have kids and are worried about the controls which you should be then you will be happy with the lock knob which disables the gas and has a wicked loud alarm if a little one tries to turn any knob.",4/9/13

The unit was defective.<br /><br />after 3 dozen emails and headache and time , now HCcost say they will accept return. who is paying huge trucking charge? shipping charge was free when they ship.<br /><br />Avoid HCcost. Avoid GE 2.7 CU FT portable washer. avoid big appliances online. when units are defective, they will blame you for causing the unit defective and seller/maker will not acknowledge the unit is defective so you are trapped with return trucking charge. The problem is you do not know it is defective until you unpack/power/connect hoses.",3/26/13

I went to a local appliance parts store and got the correct part but also paid approximately 50% more for the part. The part I recieved through the Amazon vendor didn't include any installation instructions it would have been difficult to properly install the replacement part even if it was the correct part. There were several wire harnesses included with the locally purchased replacement part as well. These were not included in the part I ordered through Amazon.

"GE PP989SNSS Profile 30"" Stainless Steel Electric Smoothtop Cooktop - Downdraft",5,Y,Replaced 30-year old JennAire,"I'd repaired our old JennAire downdraft range top over 15 times in the 14 years we've been living here. What finally made me throw it out was the 'sockets' for the heating elements were really worn out. (I can always buy new calrod heating elements, but they plug into built-in sockets - which were so worn that they wouldn't make contact any more). Replacing the sockets would have been 2 days of frustration and about $120 in parts.<br />So....<br />My wife and I decided to &#34;risk&#34; getting this ceramic cooktop. We'd heard lots of horror stories about the difficulty of keeping it clean and new-looking, but our selection of down-draft units in the same 30&#34; size was very limited.<br />I'm quite the DIY guy, cutting and fitting the fan box on the unit, and re-cutting the 6&#34; air ducting under the counter to fit. Not for the faint of heart, but this is a replacement unit, not new construction - and such things are to be expected.<br />I installed it 3 months ago. My wife uses it several times a day - and is very happy with its performance. It turns out that it's much easier to keep clean than our old JennAire! A real surprise!<br />Still looks like new and I expect it will continue to look brand new for at least the first 3 years. Haven't spent a penny on special cleaners or pads yet - just using the 2oz bottle that came with the unit, twice a week, and have only used about 1/4 ounce total so far.<br />I'd shopped around for pricing, including the big box stores - and buying it from this seller was the best deal by at least $250.",3/9/13

This cooktop appealed to me on many levels so I was praying it cooked as well as it looked. It does! It heats up much faster than anything I have ever used, and cools off immediately. You have to adjust to it at first because it is so fast. No leaving the stove waiting for things to boil, etc. I did have to get some new pans - I took a magnet with me to the store. Some cookware looks like steel but is not magnetic. Cleaning it is easy, so it always looks like new. I was pleased it was assembled in the USA.

Sure, there are quieter dishwashers out there but they don't have a food grinder.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the inside is a bit small. All of the dishes fit but it can get pretty crowded in there. Add some odd shaped dishes to the mix and suddenly the whole thing feels like tetris. I would have to say that you should avoid it if you have very tall glasses or very large plates.",3/5/13

The tray that came installed with my unit had nothing in its base to guide the water to distribute evenly. It was just smooth plastic. But the tray that came in this package has a pad across the bottom with grooves that I assume are meant to help with that even distribution. With my old tray, the water always seemed to pool on the left side (I think the unit isn't 100% level) and occasionally spill over the top. So far, this new tray seems to work much better.<br /><br />I could not possibly tell you if these parts are all Aprilaire OEM parts, nothing came in a branded box but the humidifier pad. But every piece seems to be of identical quality and construction. The only difference is the tray. If this tray is an OEM Aprilaire product, then I would love to know what was used in my original install. Regardless, the tray is great!",2/1/13

It is a specialty bulb with an unusual shape and base. I was appalled at the price of this single bulb here in the U.S. and decided to order from the UK and take a chance-I purchased 2, and even with the shipping it was less than half of what a single bulb here cost. The bulb does fit and works fine (it has the same part number as the American version), however, it is not as bright and has a yellow tone to it.  It came pretty quickly. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the bulb, but if you need the bright white light, this does not provide it.",1/27/13

GE Refrigerator Dispenser Auger WR17X11939,5,Y,Worked great but a little complicated to install,"Before installing the auger, I read the installation instructions available on the internet (none are delivered with the product) and downloaded the exploded ice maker parts diagram from the GE site.  In addition, I took photos before and after each major ice maker disassembly step needed to remove and replace the auger.  These precautions made the reassembly easier and faster with only one trial and error step during the assembly of the blades, spacers, and washers onto the new auger.  I think I am fairly good at working with mechanical devices, but if you are not, I would be wise to call the GE repairman (although the cost would be a lot more - check out the part cost at GE).",1/11/13

GE 3.2 cu. ft. Compact Refrigerator - Black,5,Y,Excellent,"I'm loving this little refrigerator. I use it for bottled drinks which saves a lot of space in my full sized fridge. It cools the drinks evenly and has no flaws that I have seen. The only drawback I'd mention is that it's a little bit ugly. It has a lock on it, which would certainly be perfect for dorm room use, but that makes the overall appearance a bit more like a safe and less like a refrigerator. I would just as soon that it not have the area for cans in the door, since I buy all of my drinks in bottles, but it has tons of space elsewhere, so there is no loss created by having that space specially designed for cans. I also keep some cheese in the fridge, and it works beautifully to keep that cool along with the drinks. I recommend it, and I think that the lock would be a valuable feature to many people out there.",1/9/13

When my home was in property management as a rental, my tenants accidentally threw away the filter bracket.  When I moved back into my home, my AC repairman serviced my unit and noticed it was missing.  For the company to replace was almost $200.  I purchased the kit for under $40 and did it myself in about 10 minutes.",1/5/13
"GE PHP960DMBB Profile 36"" Black Electric Induction Cooktop",4,Y,Love it!,"The cooktop really saves time.  Cooks faster, but food doesn't cook on it.  No knobs to clean around is a huge bonus for me.  Size and number of burners is perfect and don't have to heat in advance because it heats so fast.  This is like gas, when it is off it is off and it has a true simmer which my Whirlpool glass top did not.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I didn't really want black, which is what I was replacing.  My counters are black and I really would have preferred silver tone, which is not offered.",1/5/13
"GE Cafe CGS990SETSS 30"" Freestanding Gas Range with 5 Sealed Burners, Convection Self-Clean Double Oven and Griddle, in Stainless Steel",2,Y,Great Range but See Edit,"This is a great range with all of the features you want including a griddle for the center burner.  I use this a lot.  The burner controls are also precise and I love the right front burner.  The range on it is from power boil to the gentlest simmer.  The two ovens also give you a lot of versatility when preparing a meal.  While the range is great, the journey getting it here was quite an ordeal.  The company processed the order and then turned the stove over to the shipper.  Over the course of a month, the stove was shipped, lost, found and continued on its journey, but the delivery time was a full month from the order date.  Edit 7/19/2015  We are replacing the range, sad to say.  While we like it a lot, we have had to replace the ignitor for the lower oven twice in the last year.  This isn't one of those little cheapies and the tech told me that the ignitor is part of a series so that when it goes out, it's more complicated and expensive.  We paid about $300 for the first replacement and when it came time to do it a second time, I decided to cut my losses.  GE shouldn't put their customers in a position where when a simple part fails, it is so expensive to replace.  Lesson learned.  We had an issue with the electronics on the range and GE promptly replaced the range.  I can't say enough good things about the GE customer service we received.  Update:  We've had this range almost a year now and we are just as happy with it as we were when we bought it.  Great looking appliance and all of the bells and whistles you are looking for.  We did have an issue with an ignitor going out.  It was originally diagnosed as a failed oven board by an incompetent repairman, but the second repairman got it fixed with no problem.",1/4/13

It took me two months to finally get a repair person to come out but he guessed and ordered the wrong part (magnitron). It turned out to be something else, I can't remember what, so they have to order that. I am still waiting.  Fortunately my old microwave (Amana) still works out in the garage or I would be really frustrated. The repair person told me that GE has the most problems even though all the brands use the same components, from Korea.  Must be something about the GE specs together that blows things up.  I'll be staying clear of GE products from now on.",1/1/13
GE Filter Bypass Plug WR02X10173,5,Y,Does exactly what it says it does,Our new water purification system required that we bypass the built-in filter to get the filtered water into the icemaker. This part fixed our problem and did exactly what we needed. Works like a charm!,1/1/13

We found some &#34;half-way&#34; instructions, but we had to kind of &#34;piece together&#34; what a couple of people said, then use our own common sense to find how to get to the old one and put the new one in.

This GE product deserves a single star only as a representative of induction cooking. This was an early Christmas present from my husband and I was thrilled beyond words to get it. During the 3 days my cooktop worked, I loved it. The only complaint I had during its short life was the fact that the burners are hard to see. Unless your overhead light is excellent, it’s difficult to be sure the pot is directly on the burner. For dying on the third evening (Christmas Eve) may it melt in hell!

The basket does not fill all the way but I have ran some pretty big loads and have not noticed any spotting or problems with my clothes. The power rinse option seems to compensate for not filling the basket all the way. My preferred setting is the manual fill Super Load, with cold water for colors and warm for whites and I always use the PowerRinse option. Only drawbacks I've noticed is that the machine is much louder than I expected it to be (especially when the agitator is running) and that it took forever to ship from the dealer I ordered it from. These are the reasons I only give it a four star. Owned it for a little over a month now though and no major complaints thus far. I called GE on the noise and they said this should decrease with time and is completely normal when breaking in a new wash machine. Time will tell.",12/19/12

GE Profile : JGP945SEKSS 30 Gas Cooktop with 4 Sealed Burners - Stainless Steel,5,Y,Very Good Cooktop,We purchased this cooktop last year. We compared it with others on the market nationally and locally.  The finish is beautiful.  The stainless steel has a more substantial look and feel than others on the market.  Clean up is very easy.  The grilles are attractive and functional.  Gas is regulated at the burner very well.  The controls are metal and not plastic as other mfgrs. provide.  Rapid boil burner is very effective and provides a wide flame which is useful for large frying pans.  My Wife likes the way she can control the heat quickly and with finer adjustement than our old Jenn-Air electric cooktop.  We purchased this based on Consumer Report's recommendations.  This unit will not go out of style for a long time. Buy it.,12/10/12

Electrical connectors were a one-for-one replacement in almost the same locations on the new control unit and, it wasn't difficult to install. After studying the included notes, examining the old and new parts, taking a photo of the old one (just in case!), and marking the wires, installation took less than 10 minutes. I only needed a few basic hand tools: Philips head screwdriver, 1/4-inch nut driver, and needlenose pliers (to remove stubborn connectors).<br /><br />Works great, easy to install, and relatively inexpensive.

GE Chest Freezer - 7 cu. ft.,4,Y,Upon receipt of this freezer,"The delivery person was very helpful, He brought the freezer inside and finagled it into place. Once I opened the packaging I was pleased to note that there weren't any noticeable blemishes from transport. The freezer had great and detailed care instructions for set up (clean before use, ascertain proper temperature, etc.). When everything was set up I was very happy that it was so big on the inside when it didn't seem so large on the outside. (Kind of like the Tardis) Today my partner and I bought about forty pounds of meat and there is still tons of space! We haven't had any problems with it, I'd say the only not so great thing is that I'm short and it is a little difficult to grab food from the bottom. Love the baskets and the lock. Additional not about the lock, it wouldn't be difficult break if someone wanted but for just keeping little hands out of the ice-cream sandwiches it works fine. It's for the lock that I'm taking away one star, wish I could take away half a star. Good buy.  I'd recommend it to a friend.",11/22/12

GE Dryer LP conversion kit WE25X10014,5,Y,Capable DIY Project (How to),"Item came with all needed parts (except tools) and a simple instruction sheet that is more meant for professionals than the average homeowner. But alas it is still possible to do on your own.<br /><br />You need to take the back panel off which consists of 4 screws, the outer ones being different from the inner ones. Swap out the plug thingy and leave the back panel off. Now there are two screws underneath the panel which loosen the whole top cover. From there lift is slightly from the back pushing it towards the front and it should come right off. There are two screws that you just uncovered above the door that need to be removed along with the 4 that are on the face of the dryer (visible after opening the door). Full front panel comes off, be careful as there is a wire connecting the front panel to the dryer (supplies power to the door light) I tried to disconnected and just ended up breaking a plastic tab so just left it alone and made sure no tension was on the wires.<br /><br />Now here comes the PITA. The brass fitting you will be exchanging is on the bottom right hand corner. You will see the gas module/regulator/fancy contraption thing which is bolted down to the dryer with the black supply line coming from the right rear. And then this cone tube thing. Between the regulator and tube thing (got to really look in there) you will see the brass fitting. This is where you need a small wrench (forgot the size, 8mm or 10mm) that will barely fit but will come right off. Now putting the new one on was a HUGE PITA. The threads just wouldn't catch no matter how long I tried. What I ended up doing was unbolting the lower bracket (two screws on the left side and kind of pops up and slides out of the right side which is held in place by a slot, got to work it to get it to slide out) Then you have to disconnect the wiring to the regulator and the igniter all the way in the back right up against the massive tube back there. Remember which wires go where. And lastly behindthe dryer is a small screw over the gas supply line. Take that out and the whole contraption will come out from the front. At which point I was able to see much better and manipulate the brass fitting in to place easily and put it all back together with ease. If you can't get the brass fitting in within the first few turns save yourself the headache and just did as I did and take the whole thing out. Way easier, wish I would have done it from the start.<br /><br />Overall quite an easy DIY, just takes some patience and common sense. I'd say 3/10 on the difficulty scale. Good luck!!!",10/29/12

At this point i was wishing i would have replaced that $10.00 knob but oh well can't change that now. So i typed the model # + timer into the computer and found what i needed on the G.E. site. I wrote the price down and checked the same parts on amazon(the timer shaft and knob). On amazon i found the same parts for one hundred dollars less. Really glad i double checked. The parts arrived before they were promised(Took like three days to get here.). I now unplugged the dryer and unscrewed the controll panel. From there i put the new timer shaft in and unhooked the wires one by one and hooked them up to the new timer as i went so that way i would hook them up correctly. This is important do not unhook the wires before hand unless your a rocket scientist. Then I screwed the controll panel on and pushed on the new Knob. Plugged it back in and presto.

But the price I got them for shipped was considerably less then if I ordered directly through Viking, they wanted $15 to ship them.

"GE JB705TTWW 30"" White Electric Smoothtop Range - Convection",4,Y,GE kitchen stove (all white),"I decided to try ordering a major appliance from Amazon.com because I have always had good experiences with the things I had ordered. Even with the expensive shipping, I paid far less than buying in a local store. I found a small ding on the side panel - but did nothing about it because it could not be seen after the stove was installed. It fit the 29 7/8 inches space from my standard kitchen cabinets.",8/16/12
"GE CGP350SETSS Cafe 30"" Stainless Steel Gas Sealed Burner Cooktop",3,Y,Mixed Feelings,"I have mixed feelings about this product. On one hand, I love the overall design. GE did a great job of fitting 5 burners into a 30 inch cooktop. I looked at a lot of cooktops and they often waste a lot of space around the control knobs to one side of the burners. By putting the knobs in the front center GE conserved space that got put to good use with a fifth burner and it also makes the cooktop look very slick. I also love the griddle that's included and use it fairly often for breakfasts. I do however have some issues with the design of the burner grates. They seem to me to be too high and put too much distance between the burner and the cookware. I have a whistling tea kettle that I usually put on the medium sized burners at the front. The kettle takes much longer to boil than it did on our old glass top electric cooktop and it never really whistles much which tells me that it isn't coming to a very vigorous boil. Also, the handle of the kettle is to hot to handle without a hot pad once it does boil which suggests to me that there is a lot of heat going around the edges of the kettle and being wasted. If I put the kettle on one of the smaller rear burners it never boils. If I put it on the center \\""power boil\\"" burner it boils all right but it's too hot to handle. I've used gas ranges for many years and this has never been a problem for me before and the only differnce that I can see is the ammount of space between the burner and the cookware. If you have a larger diameter pan it isn't as much of an issue but there still seems to be a lot of heat wasted because of the design of the grates.",8/14/12
GE REFRIGERATOR WATER LINE TUBE CONNECTOR 5/16X5/16 WR02X11330,5,Y,Best of the three I've tried.,"This appears to be the best designed connector of the three that I tried.  I used it to repair a broken water tube on the back of my Kenmore Elite refrigerator, this one has a nice design that prevents the tube from going in to far.  Locks in nicely and creates a good seal.  One of the other two allowed the tube to go to far in, then the tube wouldn't go in far enough on the other side and it leaked.  The second one was better but not as good as this GE connector.  I recommend starting with this one and skip the other brands!  I like it so much I'm ordering an extra because that water line continues to be problematic.",8/13/12

Went to Home Depot (forget about it, rare do they ever have what I need), searching two to four days on line, came to my trusty Amazon.com, and there it was, right part, right size and of course the right price.

I avoided buying a set because I needed exactly three 6\\"" and one 8\\"" drip pan, while most sets seem to ship 2 of one and 2 of the other - and the combined price seemed reasonable.  The shape of the drip pans was not exactly like the previous ones, but they fit just as well, and the stove top retained heat as efficiently as before.  Shipping took less than a week.

"GE CGP350SETSS Cafe 30"" Stainless Steel Gas Sealed Burner Cooktop",5,Y,"Great Design, Quality and Easy to Clean","Anyone who says this is difficult to clean is a m_r_n (fill in the blanks).  I bought this for my wife for Mother's Day after a fair amount of research and reading the review from the first reviewer about how easy it was to clean. I previously had a GE glass top gas range that was an absolute nightmare to clean (and keep the grills clean) so frankly, I was skeptical about GE.  My wife and I have had the stainless steel GE Cafe for about two months now and could not be happier.  Installation is simple (unless, I guess, you find this range difficult to clean), the layout and extra center 20K BTU burner are great (especially for large pots and the 15\\"" cast iron pan we love to use), the included griddle is fantastic for cooking crab cakes, salmon burgers, steaks, etc., the unit looks great, and best of all, it is an absolute breeze to keep clean with simply a paper towel (anyone who says otherwise is a competitor or full of baloney) or slightly damp sponge/paper towel. We've yet to have to use any cleaners or chemicals (which I thought we would from the unavoidable oil splatter from the griddle or when pan saut&eacute;ing). At worst, after simultaneously using the griddle, the center burner to cook steamers (which boiled over) and both right burners to saut&eacute; Haddock and make saffron butter, it took me 3-4 minutes to clean up with a paper towel (and no streaks). My wife and I are thoroughly happy with the look, performance, and above all, maintainability of the GE Cafe (and with two little ones, the child lock is a definite bonus). It was also about $200 less than Best Buy (special order) with free shipping. I'd recommend this unit to anyone.",7/14/12

I'm still learning how to use the burners since they provide so much more heat then the gas range it replaces. Same for the ovens. I do most baking/broiling in the upper oven since it suits 90% of my needs and have only used the lower oven once in the convection mode. I thought all convection ovens were electric and that I would need 220V power installed. That wasn't clear in the description, but all I needed was the existing 110V and the gas line. This range is like a new car that I can't stop looking at every time I walk into the kitchen. I'm in the midst of a kitchen make-over with new cabinets, counters etc., and this range only adds to the clean, simple lines look that I want for the whole kitchen. But most important is the functionality and this range performs. Only had it for 6 weeks.<br /><br />The delivery was on-time and I slid the old range out and the new one in.

So far both items are wonderful.  The selection of cooking options is good.  I wanted a second oven for larger family gatherings.  The  oven part of the unit can do this.  It heats a little slow thought.  I probably should have gotten the 240 volt model and had the circuitry rewired for the voltage change.  Another expense to consider.  It will cook a rock hard frozen chicken breast and brown it in about 15 minutes on speed cook.  A process of applying three separate cooking techniques at adjoining times.  The food is good using this method, surprisingly so.  If you can't find the exact recipe then pick something similar.  It works.",6/21/12

GE Profile Spacemaker Series JVM1790WK 30 1.7 cu. ft. Over-the-Range Microwave Oven - White,3,Y,Oven: Good.  Installation: Very problematic.,"I had an older GE microwave above my range that died after about 8 years. When looking for a replacement I decided to go for another similar GE in order to swap it out easily, figuring it would use similar hardware. That was my first mistake.<br /><br />There's a steel plate used to mount the oven on the wall plus three big screws that go in from the cabinet on top. Not only is the plate different (requiring removal of old & installation of the new), not only are the anchor points in different places (requiring new holes), but they're placed just marginally off the old anchor points. Meaning that the integrity of the wood where you need to drill is compromised from the old screw holes. It required me to install a whole new shelf in the upper cabinet as well as trying my best to fill the old stud holes with wood filler and hoping it would be strong enough when I re-drilled.<br /><br />Here's the kicker... the installation hardware comes with butterfly screws as well as two thick wood screws for mounting to the wall studs. Unfortunately, those two wood screws are made of very cheap & weak metal. I pre-drilled guide holes as per the instructions, but when it came to screwing the screws in- the heads twisted right off on both of them (and I was careful with the second one after the first one broke). The screws were already 3/4 of the way in, leaving me with no way to remove them and blocking the ability to try again in the same spot (a spot required for proper installation).  The oven isn't light, the installation requires heavy duty hardware, why ship the microwave with such crappy screws?<br /><br />Lessons:<br /><br />Buy your own mounting hardware.<br />When it comes to buying a replacement appliance, there's no value in nepotism.",6/18/12

It is so much quicker to cook with, no fears of burning yourself and easy clean-up. The product was easy to install, although I did have to have an electrician come and pull some wire, but after than, it was a fast easy installation. I did buy new pots and pans (I was due for them) and all I did was find pots & pans that a magnet would stick to the bottom of and they were compatible. I didn't buy anything special or super costly. The item came packaged very well, instructions were clear and I'm off and running. I love the sleek, contemporary, no clutter look.  There's no fear of leaving a burner on, once you remove the pot/pan it shuts off. There is a warning light that that tells you the cooktop is still hot after cooking. I did touch the cooktop after cooking and, although it was hot, nothing that could burn the skin off your hands. My electrician was so totally impressed and surprised by this item as well. It has a timer built in and you can lock the cooktop for cleaning or if you have children as it is touch sensitive.  Just don't know why I didn't do this a long time ago!",6/2/12

GE Gneral Electric DRYER LIGHT BULB WE4M305,5,Y,This is not a night life bulb,I had read in some of the reveiws that the 10 watt bulbs utilized for electric clothes dryers were nothing more than cheap night life bulbs.  I just recieved this bulb and I can tell you that it is not a night life bulb.  The glass is much thicker and seems to have a more complex filliment.  It is packed in a small cardboard box marked with the part number and manufactring data  The bulb shape is slightly different than a night life bulb but it fits and works perfectly in my 9 year old Sears Kenmore Electric Dryer.  Eight dollars seems a little steep but it is an appliance bulb and I did not have to drive around all day at 4 dollars/gallon to find this.  Im happy.,3/26/12

General Electric WE4M364 Timer PLAS. Shaft,5,Y,General Electric Timer Shaft,"I ordered the same model type dryer-timer but it came minus a Y (yellow) connection. Its original yellow cable from my dryer base was just one dividing into a Y-type connection onto the timer shaft.  This type made it have two yellow connections.  But since I did not have that extra Y connector I simply taped the Y-type connection to what I believe was the X conection (also using the other yellow cable), and so far the drier works fine.  I still need a knob, so I am not quite sure what cycle timer it may be missing.  I believe it may be missing no cycles.  This was an easy job to do.  Do not unplug the cables from the timer shaft until this part arrives; that way you will know where the cables go.  Please be cautios, like any other appliance, please disconnect your appliance from its electrical outlet before servicing.",3/4/12

"GE Microwave Oven Charcoal Filter, WB2X2892",5,Y,Range Hood Filter...Didn't realize they wore out!,"Our original GE Range Hood filter was just there and was rarely thought of. While we glanced at it from time to time and would occasionally wipe it down, it neither drew nor required any special attention. Then, one day, this 20+ year-old filter started to sag. Before we realized it, the edge started to separate and charcoal pellets started to fall on to the top of the range. So, the first question I had was where do you start to look for such an item. I checked the Owners Manual (Yes; I always keep them!) and found the model number but wondered if this minor an item was still available. I found a couple of sites that listed these filters and was surprised when I was able to find it based on the filter's model number. But, the first couple of sites listed it for $50+ and $35+. Then, I thought of Amazon. Imagine my surprise when I found that not only did I also find it under the manufacturer's model number but for $14! I ordered it, received it, installed it and it works fine. In fact, the charcoal is no longer pelletized but is in more of a sheet form, so it should never fall apart again. I usually check Amazon first and should have for this item, also. Who knew that Amazon would carry this, too? It seems that there's nothing that they don't carry!",1/29/12

General Electric WE4M364 Timer PLAS. Shaft,3,Y,Not exact replacement,Part was not an exact match.  Connectors were different and mounting was different.  Missing an advanced delicate drying cycle.  I was able to drill 2 new mounting hole to mount it.  Had to cut a notch in dryer control panel to allow part to slip into place.  Had to determine what side was up using original timer.  Connectors were different but connections had the same IDs.  Original wires had to be removed from connectors keeping original lugs attached to wires.  One wire had to be re-lugged.  Electrical drawing was used to verify timer functions and what color wire to connect what timer terminal ID.  It works but a 30 minute job became a 90 job because of non-exact replacement.  Works fine just like original minus delicate dry cycle.  Above normal electrical and mechanical skills required.,1/22/12

GE Spacemaker® 1.7 Cu. Ft. Over-the-Range Sensor Microwave Oven,4,Y,"Basic and Solid Function, Tricky Installation","I Replaced an old (1995) model of this Profile Spacemaker Microwave. It was very difficult to insert the exhaust vent fitting on the top of the microwave into the chimney vent during installation. If your microwave fits flush with the underside of your cabinet be prepared for a challenge when you swing the microwave into position, using the rear wall bracket hinge, and the vent fitting catches on the leading edge of the opening in your cabinet. I had to cut a deep bevel in this leading edge in order to get this fitting to swing into place.  The microwave itself looks clean and neat but nothing fancy. Just the basics. It seems to be built well and it seems to have a solid construction (a big improvement over the old model). I am very happy with the oven's functioning and its ability to do the standard jobs that you expect a new microwave to do.",12/18/11

"GE PHP900DMBB Profile 30"" Black Electric Induction Cooktop",5,Y,A New World,"This cook top is every thing I had hoped it would be. I was replacing another 30\\"" cook top, so all I did was open the breaker, check to see if the circuit was dead, broke the old connection, popped-out the old cook top, dropped-in the GE, reconnected the wiring, closed the breaker, and that was it.  One note, if you downloaded the instructions beforehand: a couple of times the instructions make bold note that if you have aluminum wiring, then you need Al to Cu connectors.  Yep, but the COOK TOP has Al wiring, so if you have Cu wiring you need special wire nuts.  A simple, online check with Lowes or Home Depot, or a call to a local appliance store, to check availability and get three wire nuts for an Al to Cu connection.  For those with a science acumen, it's the galvanic action between the two, dissimilar metals that will cause corrosion--some will, incorrectly, say it's electrolysis, but that requires an electrolytic solution.<br />A few reviews as to cookware seem moot.  If one doesn't know what magnetic induction is, perhaps one should read-up on it before considering this item.  I recently changed cookware to Le Creuset Tri-Ply because I needed new cookware and had induction cooking in mind, also.  This is excellent cookware.  Lesser cookware will work on this cook top as long as it's of a ferrous material--stainless steel or cast iron.  However, the performance of this cook top using this cookware is outstanding--much better than my ancient experience with gas.  Amazing!<br />As for the 40 amp power requirement, when I popped the old cook top out, I noticed that the power rating was virtually the same as the GE one.  This cook top ran for years on a 30 amp circuit.  It should have been a 40 amp circuit, but the good ole boy electricians--I'm being generous--in rural East Texas used a 30 amp circuit and the old cook top never tripped the breaker.  Induction cooking has to use less power than an electrical resistance cook top.  Yes, induction and resistance are related, but using electrical resistance to heat has to be right up there with a wood-burning stove as to inefficiency.<br />Short version.  Get this cook top and some Al to Cu wire nuts.  You'll have no buyer's remorse.<br />BTW, instead of paying out the nose for an induction plate (hob) for use with your non-ferrous cookware, just get a cast iron griddle--preferably one without the built-up ring on the bottom. You're have to deal with the high specific heat, and resulting \\""thermal battery\\"" of cast iron, but you won't need to use it that much. It's something that you'll probably want to have, anyway.<br /><br />One year later: Outstanding!",12/8/11
GE Part Number WB20X5050 PROBE,5,Y,best probe ever,I could not find this anywhere for this price and it was just like the original one I accidentally destroyed.  It shipped fast and was just what I wanted at a better price.,12/4/11
GE PSA2200RWW Profile Advantium 1.7 Cu. Ft. White Over-the-Range Microwave,4,Y,"Amazing oven, so much more than just a microwave","This is an amazing oven.  The combination of halogen lights, convection and microwave do a great job of quickly re-heating or cooking many different types of food items.  Pizza, when re-heated in a microwave, is soggy and unappetizing.  Using speedcook with aforementioned heat sources working simultaneously the crust is crisp while the toppings are perfectly done in only 3 minutes vs 10 for a conventional oven.  Breaded Chicken and Fish do very well in this oven, turning out light and crisp in their own oils.  One could think of many examples of food that cook better in this oven than an ordinary microwave.<br /><br />The vent function at 300CFM is adequate, and more effective than I might have guessed.  Smoke and fumes from the front burners underneath flow to the rear exiting the exhaust filters.  I noticed the vent also has some intakes on top behind the door front panel.  Two of these on either side appear designed to cool the lamps and electronics, but the large intake in the center draws air in from above the door.  At first I was confused about the purpose of drawing air from above the microwave.  But after a couple months of use and no grease on the cabinets above I have come to the conclusion that this is actually a clever design to inhale any grease fumes that escape upward past the front of the oven door.  This over-the-range unit does not extend like a hood to the front of the range, but the air intake above and behind the door does a good job at clearing the air as if it did!  Of course, do a good job on the sheetmetal duct install to maintain maximum flow.  I used 8\\"" duct with a rectangular-to-round adapter and a high flow AirKing roof cap.<br /><br />The user interface is excellent.  To just look at a picture of the touch panel it might appear that this is just another membrane keypad ALA microwaves of the 1980s.  But no, it is a glass capacitive touch screen mechanism like a smartphone, sans the display function.  I would expect this to have a nearlyunlimited lifespan.  There are many pre-programmed food types that are not only convenient to access, but serve as a reference to help one quickly learn what types of heating are appropriate for different foods.  One can choose different levels of upper and lower radiant lamp heat, convection heat, and microwave heat to best suit the food being prepared.<br /><br />This review is for the 240V model, so you are likely to have to run another circuit.  In my case that was not terribly difficult.  I did not try the 120V version, but based on some reading it appears that the extra power is well worth it.  I checked my digital (smart) electric meter with the oven on, and with it off, and it appears to draw close to the full 7.2kW (30 amps at 240V) of power, although only for a few minutes.  It is a speedcook oven, after all.<br /><br />It's not cheap, but I really like it.  The wife loves it too.  But don't spend the money if you only want a microwave.<br /><br />Edit:  after 11 months of use, the vent fan located in the top rear of the microwave failed - it started making a horrible noise.  Removal of the microwave and fan showed it is a double squirrel-cage design, where the right side of the double cage had been rubbing it's plastic housing.  Both the fans and their associated housing are some sort of plastic, probably fiber-reinforced.<br /><br />A call to GE revealed they would fix it, given that it was barely under the one year warranty.  The technician arranged to have the replacement fan shipped to my house via Fedex.  Although they called to confirm the appointment to come over and install it two days after it arrived, I declined as I had already installed the fan by then.  The wife and kids don't like to be without this oven.<br /><br />After the new fan was installed, I realized it was likely the original fan had been rubbing the housing since Day One as the replacement was slightly more quiet.  When I spoke with the GE technician he said every oven out therehas one of these fans, or similar, in it and he replaces very few.  Hopefully that bodes well for the long life of the replacement fan.<br /><br />Still, one star is deducted for poor quality control at the factory.  I should not have had to replace it.  I do believe it was a fluke, but time will tell.<br /><br />Edit 2:  One year on the replacement vent fan and no issues.  Probably not a recurring problem.",12/3/11

I read a review on one of the other racks which said to count the grids on your present rack and match that number to one that has the same number of grids.  Voila!  It arrived, it fit perfectly!

GE Profile : PDWT580RSS 24 Built-In Dishwasher - Stainless Steel,2,Y,Think Twice Doesn't clean well,"My spouse and I purchased this in spite of a couple reservations due to previous reviews. We had other GE profile appliances and were happy with those.  When the appliance was received, it was damaged.   We didn't want to install since it was damaged and unsure what the fix would be.  When I called GE I was told it would have to be installed before they would send someone out so called the third party AJ Madison instead.  They set up for a GE repairman to come out.   He said it was factory damaged and would need to be replaced.  (And I didn't have to install to get this answer).   The new dishwasher came quickly and was installed.  However, now that it is installed I am NOT HAPPY with the unit.   The racks are such that the dishes move around when sliding bottom rack in and out and have to continuously rearrange the dishes.   When using the manual detergent dispenser the cleaning was more or less OK but decided to test the dispenser for holding a full bottle of detergent.  I rinsed the dishes thoroughly, even though the manual says this is not necessary.   I do make sure the water is hot before turning on the dishwasher and still had dirty dishes at end of cycle.   I will test it again using the manual detergent dispenser but so far I would say if you want a dishwasher that cleans look elsewhere.",6/18/11

I asked if they could be sent via overnight delivery and she said they did not have that capability.  I asked for a manager and she said I could place a claim but the claim office was closed.

We bought the extension ring (from somewhere else) and it didn't seem very helpful but perhaps we didn't understand how best to use it. This particular model is discontinued and replace with a new one, but the new one did not have the 3-ring burner, and had a digital touch instead of knobs that we thought would make it harder to keep track of the temperature setting.",5/16/11
"GE Filter - MWF, GWF, MWFA, GWFA, GWF06 also Fits Kenmore 46-9991 and Hotpoint HWF HWFA",3,Y,Product photo is misleading,"1. Although the product description says in fine print \\""by Water Sentinel\\"" the product photo seems to suggest it is made by GE with GE logo prominently displayed and all the GE models listed. When I purchased it, I was under the impression that I was getting a GE product. No. It is a generic replacement for the authentic item. If you are expecting a genuine GE item then skip this product.  2. The installation instructions were straightforward and if followed precisely work just fine. You have to make sure that the \\""O\\"" ring provided is in place before you install it otherwise you'll get water leaks...more like torrents. They do provide an extra \\""O\\"" ring just in case the one with the filter falls off or is not in place.  3. As for performance, after the initial air-bubbles cleared, it works as advertised. I can't tell any difference in water quality or taste than from the genuine GE filter. Since I just installed it today, I can't speak for the long term performance.  4. Unlike GE, it comes with a set of month stickers. You can either put one on the filter to indicate the month of installation or the month when the filter needs replacement (usually about 6 months later). On my refrigerator there is an indicator light that comes on when the filter is to be replaced. So I put the sticker to indicate the month of installation.    I just wish the product description was clearer on the manufacturer/distributer so that the purchaser won't feel deceived as I did. To me it is a matter of truth in advertising and the manufacturer's integrity. For this reason I only give it three stars.",5/13/11

It is everything that I expected and I am very happy with it.  It is so much easier to clean than any other range I've had, just a soapy, damp sponge to clean the grime, another wipe down with it rinsed out, and then some window cleaner.  My friends who come to visit are impressed with how fast it boils a pot of water, and the oven is large and accurate.  I am as much a baker as a stovetop chef and even two trays of cookies come out evenly.  I've also used the temperature probe when roasting meats and, wow, how wonderful that is!  My stove now tells me when the roast is done.  I know that some people have expressed concerns regarding noise from the coils cycling on and off.  It is so minimal that unless you are living in a monastery you won't really notice it at all.  What more can I say?

The unit just fit under the counter and was otherwise a VERY tight squeeze compared to the GE it replaced.  That extra capacity has to come from somewhere.  Fortunately, there was a tile floor under the unit at the same hight as our hardwood, because I've heard that sometimes floor installers manage to box in the dishwasher during a kitchen remodel and you have to pop the countertop!

GE Profile : PDWT500RWW 24 Built-In Dishwasher - White,5,Y,Great Dishwasher,"This unit replaced a KitchenAid that was about 10 years old.  The unit arrived in great condition.  All hookups were standard and the necessary parts easily obtained at a local hardware store (3/8\\"" elbow, compression fittings and/or flexible supply line, thread tape, etc.).      Fit and finish seem great.  The white baked-on enamel seems durable, the interior is large, racks adjustable, and it's nice to have the option of automatic liquid detergent dispensing.  Be sure to follow the directions on that, though.  Apparently if you switch between bleach-based and enzyme-based liquids you will clog the unit, so use one or the other and stick to it.  Plenty of cycle choices as well.  And, of course, you can just use regular powder/pellet/gel pack detergents in the standard dispenser.  It also has several baskets for silverware, utensils, small items, etc. that you can mix/match/remove depending on what you are washing.  Very convenient.  This seemed to be one area at this price point where we made a choice - multiple adjustable baskets vs. a single basket with a large third cutlery tray.  We chose this unit because we wanted the liquid detergent dispenser and cycle options.    The unit is really quiet.  This one comes with an upgraded insulated toe kick, so it's just about inaudible.  The racks adjust for items, and the top rack height adjusts.  Three sprayers arms are present as well.  Dishes come out clean and dry.  We are really pleased with the unit.",2/2/11

Freezer will hold a few packages of frozen food and a couple of quarts of ice cream, and maybe a couple ice cube trays.     Nice feature is a metal rack under the center shelf for 5 wine bottles. Not boldly mentioned, but could be significant to others, is the lockable door, for when it's used in an office environment, or to keep the beer from being pilfered.     It is reasonably quiet, making only a soft whirr when starting. The unit came reasonably well-packaged although a corner in the back is ever so slightly wrinkled from being set down too hard during transport. Not noticed where it sits.    To AMAZON's ( and FED-Ex's ) Credit it arrived at my Arizona home just 26 hours after I ordered it, delivered from the Austin TX warehouse! and for the low-low one-day Prime shippers fee. Cannot be beat.     Recommend this over others because of the depth and overall capacity, AND the white interior that shows contents better and is much easier to keep clean.",11/22/10

GE Oven Bake Element WB44T10010,5,Y,Just what I was looking for :-),"I have an older oven that is a GE model number JBP64BH3WH. One day my wife was making biscotti, and 20 minutes later when she pulled it out of the oven, we noticed that it wasn't even cooked! That is because the old heating element literally snapped in two. I thought, GREAT I'm going to need to buy a new oven. But luckily I looked up the model number on Google, found the part number for this element, and checked out Amazon. By far this is the cheapest place to buy it. It arrived in a nicely packaged box, and the installation was simple.<br /><br />There are two bolts that hold the old element in. Use a socket wrench, or a pair of vice grips or something, and they will come out easily. Once they're out, gently pull out the old element until you can see the attached wires. They have little butt-crimp connectors on there. It might take a little force to slid the connectors off the old element. Just don't strip the wires by accident. Put the new element in place, slide the connectors on, gently put it back in place and screw in the bolts, and you're back in business.<br /><br />I pre-heated mine for a while just to make sure it was working. brilliant! great price to fix an old oven.

We chose this smaller, less powerful model and we are only somewhat satisfied. It takes significantly longer than anticipated to defrost, heast frozen items; i.e., frozen vegetables.  We do not use our microwave for significant cooking tasks so we thought for the price this would be a good fit. It is okay. Not sure I would buy it again; but we aren't taking it back at this point either.[[ASIN:B002X7669C GE JES0736SPSS Stainless Steel Countertop Microwave Oven]]",6/9/10
GE Oven Bake Element WB44T10010,5,Y,OEM range bake element WB44T10010,"My old element was broken, literally, in two pieces by the previous owner (the range came with the house I bought). Found this replacement part at a very reasonable price. It works just as it's supposed to, and I enjoyed a homemade (not frozen) pizza last night.",5/28/10
General Electric GENERAL ELECTRIC WB15X10070 MICROWAVE DOOR HANDLE,5,Y,Great Company,Great vendor. Very prompt shipping. Would buy from them again in a second! Given the fact I own GE appliances I am sure I will need to as well. GE Appliances will NEVER be on my shopping list again.,4/30/10
GE : GTS18FBSWW Refrigerator,4,Y,Great value for the money,We bought this as a garage frig about 2 years ago. The delivery men were super nice by the way. It works great. It is plain with no frills and that was what we needed. No ice maker means the freezer holds a lot. I store a lot of drinks in the bottom and have to be careful where I put cases of water and soda because the shelves can't take slamming things in there. They will fall. If you take your time....it holds all though and I do put a lot of strain on them. The door shelves are big...and I love that. The door won't close if something is sticking out too far and hits the door shelves and I don't always notice that.,4/10/10
GE Oven Bake Element WB44T10010,5,Y,Quick and easy replacement for a big hassle!,"The other night while my parents were baking their oven's element literally burned up like a sparkler.  My mom was pretty mad and sent my dad to check out a replacement.  The local appliance store here was selling the replacement for upwards of $80 dollars.<br /><br />I hopped on Amazon.com and found the same model for 50 dollars less!  The seller was great and got the replacement to their house in 2 days, my dad installed it and the baking continues!<br /><br />This is definitely a great product and a quick and easy fix.",3/24/10
GE Oven Bake Element WB44T10010,5,Y,Stove/oven/Range Bake Element,Purchasing this item through Amazon saved my over $60 on the item itself.  It was delivered to my home in tact and the instructions for the installation were easy to follow.  The instructions were so easy to follow that my 17year old daughter installed the element.  The oven works great now!!!,3/18/10
GE GFSFR02 Refrigerator Filter Fresh Pack (2-Pack),5,Y,Good deal!,This was a good deal compared to all others I shopped around for. My only beef is that the fresh packs came with the holder which I didn't need because they are already in the fridge. I consider it a waste and it defeats the purpose of recycling.,2/25/10
GE GSC3500NWW Portable Dishwasher 5 LVL (White),5,Y,"Best there is, concerning portable dishwashers","I had been researching portable dishwashers for some time now, and finally chose the GE 24 inch.    Take it from me, you probably do NOT want one of those counter-top models; not if you have regular sized pots and pans and large dinner plates like me.  If you are going to cook a bunch, then you need the real deal--24\\"" is the standard size.    The delivery was spectacular: the delivery men called me a day in advance to let me know it would be delivered between a certain time frame, and then the day of, they called me again to let me know they would be at my house within one hour.  They brought the dishwasher up a flight of stairs without damaging it.  They opened the dishwasher for me, took off all the packing materials and put it where I wanted it.  Such A+ service!!    It even came with a small tube of Jet Dry and a coupon for the next purchase of one!    The only, ONLY drawback is that damned short hose in the back.  Only about 30 inches from the dishwasher to your facet is all you get.  The dishwasher literally is backed as close to the counter as possible to reach.    A great detailed review of this product is in a blog called \\""A Chef's Daughter.\\""  Have a look at that if you are in the market for a portable dishwasher.",1/23/10
GE JX81B Recirculating Charcoal Filter,5,Y,Microwave Charcol Filter,"Not much to say about a charcol filter.  This product was in perfect new condition, fit exactly as it should and was much less expensive then the manufacturer's filter. I will buy these as my ongoing replacement filters.",6/29/09
General Electric WD8X229 Dishwasher Door Gasket,4,Y,Was I suppossed......?,"Was I supposed to stretch it out even more before I used it? Our dishwasher is 12 years old. I was happy to have found a resonable replacement part but I had to \\""gerry rig\\"" it to make it fit.",6/12/09
"GE JP989SKSS ProfileTM 30"" Downdraft Electric Cooktop",5,Y,The GE JP989 cooktop is great.,"GE JP989SKSS ProfileTM 30\\"" Downdraft Electric Cooktop is better than expected.  I was concerned about the 400 CFM downdraft, but it is strong enough to pull steam from sauce pans out of the kitchen.  I had a few questions about instillation for GE and this is where the rubber meets the road. GE Tech Support bent over backwards to answer all questions about instillation.  I installed it myself.  It took several hours. Removing the old cooktop also took several hours. The hardest part was connecting the downdraft vent to the vent pipe.  Simply use 6 inch flexible pipe and clamps which can be purchased at any home supply store.  I had to crimp the male end of the exhaust pipe to get the flexible pipe to easily connect.  (Crimpers can be purchased at any big box home supply store, or go to a sheet metal shop and they will probably do it for free or a nominal cost.  Specs call for a 40 AMP circuit breaker.  We had a 30 AMP for our older cooktop so we had an electrician come out to install a new 40 AMP breaker.  He convinced me not to do it.  He said, \\""if you start popping the breaker, then simply call me back to install a 40 AMP breaker, but the average customer is not going to have all burners on HIGH simultaneously\\"".  He is right.  Might have one on high to boil water, you don't do normal cooking on the high settings. This is a great cooktop, far superior than our Kitchen Aid.  The major reason for deciding on GE was parts.  GE carries parts for ever.  When Kitchen Aid discontinues a model, they don't carry parts and we were forced to purchase the GE due to not having available parts from Kitchen Aid.",5/1/09
GE Black Full Console 24-Inch Portable Dishwasher,3,Y,ge dishwasher,"Was told delivery within 6 days, then it was to be a month, then 3 weeks, then someone appeared on my doorstep with one but I couldn't take it that day. Then called and said it would be there the next day in the afternoon- then I had to contact them to tell them afternoon was not convenient so they sent a snippy email but did deliver in the AM.<br />It's not black on black but black on white -but who would want to deal with these people again? Surely not me.<br />The d/w works well but just don't buy it from these folks if you want straightforward communication and if you want what you ordered.",2/26/09
GE GSC3500NWW Portable Dishwasher 5 LVL (White),5,Y,Finally!,"I love my portable dish washer!  This machine is not 'fancy' but it gets the job done with a minimum of fuss.  It has all the standard washer features including a container for spot free rinse solution, open and closed soap cups, normal and pots/pans cycles, hot start, rinse only etc.  The machine rolls easily on the casters and hooking it up to the kitchen sink was an easy matter of changing the faucet aerator with the one included.  The hose simply snaps on, plug in to electric and you're off and washing.  The top of the washer is a wood laminate that serves nicely as extra counter space.  Been using this machine for a few weeks  and see no cons as of yet.  Be advised that there are several pieces of styrofoam inside the machine that you need to remove before use.  I missed one but luckily this had no ill effect.  If you miss the one under the heating coil, you could have a mess.",8/22/08
