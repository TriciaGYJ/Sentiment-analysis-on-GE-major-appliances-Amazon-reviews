# Sentiment-analysis-on-GE-major-appliances-Amazon-reviews

This is the final project for course 'Neutral Network for Business Application'. This project aims to predict Amazon customers’ attitude towards GE major appliances by conducting a sentiment analysis on customers’ reviews. 3 neutral network models, simple RNN, LSTM and word2vec are implemented and data will be trained into 3 groups, negative, neutral and positive based on their rating and reviews. Different models will be validated based on its accuracy and loss, and compared by its accuracy through confusion matrix. The results can help company decide whether or not they should spend more money to invest or campaign GE products on Amazon.
